He was born on 06 November 1993 in England, United Kingdom. He is, therefore, British and not American, as some would erroneously assume. Unfortunately, his mother, attorney Samantha Berg, suffered an amniotic fluid embolism while birthing him. She slipped into a coma as a result and never recovered, finally passing away in 2007.</p><p>Elliot Grange’s father, on the other hand, is Sir Lucian Charles Grainge. He is the chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, one of the biggest record labels in America. He is in his second marriage with Elliot’s stepmother, Caroline Grainge. Elliot has two step-sisters, Alice Grainge and Betsy Grainge, from his father’s second marriage.</p><h3><strong>Elliot Grainge’s Birthday Dates</strong></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Birthdate</strong></td><td><strong>Day</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>6 November</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>6 November</td><td>Thursday</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>6 November</td><td>Friday</td></tr><tr><td>2027</td><td>6 November</td><td>Saturday</td></tr><tr><td>2028</td><td>6 November</td><td>Monday</td></tr><tr><td>2029</td><td>6 November</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>6 November</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>He Moved to the United States in 2009 for College</strong></h3><p>Elliot spent his childhood and teenage years in the U.K. He attended a local private school in the United Kingdom before moving to the United States in 2009. This move was partially influenced by his father’s promotion to the International Chairman of Universal Music Group in 2005. The whole family settled in Los Angeles, while Elliot enrolled in Northeastern University in Boston.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/american-british-musician-elliot-grainge.png alt width=770 height=455 sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As a student, Elliot started his first business venture with a fellow student partner. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree, he moved back to Los Angeles and launched his record label 10K Project. The label is focused more on artistic integrity than commercial success. The now 30-year-old music executive has successfully made a name for himself away from his father’s shadows.</p><h2><strong>What is Elliot Grainge’s Net Worth as of 2023?</strong></h2><p>Elliot Grainge’s net worth in 2023 is estimated at $10 million. He is a successful music record label executive with a lot going for him. His label 10K projects has <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">20-plus</a> artists signed under them, with coverage in both the U.S. and U.K. markets. 18 gold and eight platinum/multi-platinum singles with 22 billion streams translates to massive profits from streaming platforms, as well as profits from concerts, collaborations, live events, tours, and ticket and album sales.</p><p>According to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Tone Deaf</a>, top music executives earn an average salary ranging from $200K to $500K annually, plus equity from performance-based incentives, such as stock options. With many years of successfully working in the industry, Elliot Grainge is estimated to be worth $10 million in assets.</p><p>In 2021, Elliot was named in the exclusive Forbes’ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">30 Under 30</a>, showing him as one of the young entrepreneurs transforming the music scene. In 2022, Elliot Grainge and his fiancée purchased a $26.9 million mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, that once belonged to UTA’s CEO Jeremy Zimmer. This purchase shows Elliot Grainge’s financial prowess.</p><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td><strong>Assets and Properties</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>10K Projects Record Label</td><td>$7 million</td></tr><tr><td>Brentwood Mansion</td><td>$25 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Elliot Grainge’s also Earns from Successful Business Ventures</strong></h3><p>While in school Grainge partnered with Boston University student Robbie Earl to create and run their company ‘<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Take Boston</a>’. ‘Take Boston’ was all about providing a unique nightlife experience for partygoers in Boston. They partner with teams like Timeflies, and The Lansdowne Pub. The company was also part of the process that raised $18,000 for victims of the Boston Marathon bombings</p><p>After graduating from Northeastern, Elliot Grainge moved back to Los Angeles and started the indie record label <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">10K Projects</a>. He started the label by signing Trippie Redd and controversial rapper Tekashi6ix9ine. 10K Projects now has artists like Iann Dior, Internet Money, and Poor Stacy as well as bands like Surfaces, and Peach Tree Rascals working under it. According to Forbes, 10K Projects has had 18 gold and eight platinum/multi-platinum singles that have accumulated a total of 22 billion streams.</p><h3><strong>Elliot Grainge’s Net Worth Growth</strong></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>$10 million</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>$10 million</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>$9 million</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>$8 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Did Elliot Grainge Inherit His Wealth From His Family?</strong></h2><p>Elliot Grainge obviously comes from a wealthy family and his father is worth a whopping $50 million. But from what we have seen so far, it appears Elliot Grainge worked hard for his money. He no doubt inherited the entrepreneurial spirit from his dad. Right from University, he was already running his business. It is therefore not surprising that he would hit the ground running once he kicked off his music label venture.</p><p>10K Projects was founded in 2016 and has been quite successful thus far. However, Elliot also had some help with the Virgin Music Label & Artist Services, a division of Universal Music Group that helped with the distribution aspect of the label. Elliot Grainge has access to the wealth of knowledge and connection his father has amassed in his years in the industry. However, the bulk of the work rested on his shoulders as an indie music executive.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/elliot-grainge-and-chairman-ceo-of-universal-music-group-news-photo-1617805641.jpeg alt="What Is Elliot Grainge’s Age and How Much is His Net Worth?" width=768 height=597 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2><strong>Who is Elliot Grainge’s Dad, Sir Lucian Charles Grainge</strong></h2><p>Lucian Charles Grainge has worked in the entertainment industry his entire career. The 63-year-old from North London was once the director of RCA Music Publishing and A&R director for MCA Records before joining Universal Music in 1986. He later rose to become the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group before his promotion to chairman and CEO.</p><p>Sir Lucian Charles Grainge has worked with top artists like Lady Gaga, ABBA, Jay-Z, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Amy Winehouse, Queen, Rihanna, Sam Smith, U2, Katy Perry, and lots more. He reportedly has a net worth of above $50 million and is named the most <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">powerful</a> person in the music industry and the first-ever Executive of the Decade by Billboard magazine. In 2016, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for his accomplishments and leadership in the music business. He also has a star to his name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>Thanks to his dad, Elliot Grainge had some insight into the workings of the music business before venturing into it.
