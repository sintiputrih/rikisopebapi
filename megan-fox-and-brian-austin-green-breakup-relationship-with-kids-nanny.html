Still, there are a lot of people who are interested in knowing <a href=#>how Austin Green and Burgess met</a> and became a couple.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Megan Fox And Machine Gun Kelly Fell In Love While Filming Midnight In The Switchgrass</a></span></p><p>Of course, neither of those relationships would exist today if Austin Green and Fox were still committed to one another. Married for more than a decade, Fox and Austin Green's relationship may be over now, but they will always be linked due to the children they share.</p><p>Like a lot of other parents, <a href=#>Fox has said that her kids helped her find her purpose in life</a>. Despite that, Fox has admitted to struggling when she first became a mom. In fact, according to Fox, things got so bad that getting a nanny extended her marriage to Austin Green.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-39-s-marriage>The Truth About Megan Fox And Brian Austin Green's Marriage</h2><p>Before starring in Transformers turned Megan Fox into a world-famous movie star, she was busy starring in the sitcom Hope & Faith. During the production of that show, Fox met Brian Austin Green when he landed a guest-starring role in the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Think Brian Austin Green Dislikes Megan Fox’s New Man, Machine Gun Kelly</a></span></p><p>In the years that followed Fox and Austin Green's first meeting, the two actors would go on to garner a lot of headlines due to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ups and downs of their relationship</a>. On top of that, their relationship was controversial since Austin Green was 30 when they met and Fox was only 18.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Austin Green and Fox reportedly began dating in 2004, they announced their engagement in 2006. However, that big step didn't mean things would go smoothly for Fox and Austin Green in the years that followed.</p><p>Amid rumors that Austin Green had been unfaithful, the couple's engagement was called off in 2009, and they split up. Despite that, Fox and Austin Green repeatedly were spotted together in the months that followed and in 2010 they reconciled and pledged to get married once again.</p><p>Not long after they got back together, Fox and Austin Green tied the knot in a private 2010 wedding. Then, two years later the couple welcomed their first child into the world in 2012.</p><p>Sadly, in 2015 the public learned that Fox had filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Still, reports suggested that Austin Green and Fox continued to live together even after that filing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Fox never moved forward with her 2015 plans to divorce Austin Green, it wasn't until April 2019 that she dismissed the motion she filed.</p><p>In 2020, rumors began to surface that Fox and Austin Green had split. Later that same year Fox filed for divorce and this time around the process went forward.</p><h2 id=why-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-39-s-marriage-lasted-so-long>Why Megan Fox And Brian Austin Green's Marriage Lasted So Long</h2><p>Even though Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green eventually split, there is no denying that they stayed married for a long time. As it turns out, however, Fox once revealed that at one point in their marriage, she and Austin Green were so close to divorcing that someone had to come in and save them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Megan Fox Friends With Brian Austin Green's Girlfriend Sharna Burgess?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Fox and Austin Green's first child was born in 2012, Megan spoke to the Daily Mirror. During the resulting conversation, Fox was willing to admit to struggling after giving birth.</p><p>Unfortunately, since people often harshly judge other parents, a lot of people are reluctant to be open about how hard being a parent can be. To Fox's credit, however, she was willing to be open about how much she struggled after her first child with Austin Green was born.</p><p>"Having an infant is difficult. It's a lot of work and I didn't hire any help because I overestimated my own abilities. I had no idea how difficult babies could be, so Brian and I were exhausted.
