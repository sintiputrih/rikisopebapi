She shares the same parents with her two older sisters, Valdirene and Vanessa.</p><p>Ivete, Nunes’ mother, has been characterized by Nunes as a strict yet caring mother. Ivete suggested that Amanda participate in athletics as a method to channel her surplus energy.</p><p>Beginning in elementary school as a member of the neighborhood Pojuca team and then the Salvador team, Nunes initially wanted to play professional soccer.</p><p>She eventually had the chance to try out for the Vitória football team, but she declined since her mother preferred that she concentrate on her schoolwork.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Amanda Nunes career</h2><p>At Prime MMA Championship 2, on March 8, 2008, Nunes made her professional debut. In the opening round, she met Ana Maria and was beaten by armbar submission.</p><p>Before making her Strikeforce debut on January 7, 2011, at Strikeforce Challengers: Woodley vs. Saffiedine in Nashville, Tennessee, Nunes had won five straight fights, all by knockout. Julia Budd, a Canadian, was knocked out in just 14 seconds by her.</p><p>On June 18, 2011, in Dallas, Texas, Nunes was slated to face Julie Kedzie at Strikeforce: Overeem vs. Werdum. Nunes’ foot issue forced the cancellation of the fight.</p><p>On September 10, 2011, at Strikeforce: Barnett vs. Kharitonov, Nunes faced Alexis Davis. In the late stages of the second round, she was defeated by TKO.</p><p>Nunes made a powerful opening salvo in the opening round, but he rapidly lost steam. After the first round, Nunes was worn out by the second one. She was immediately turned around while trying a takedown, which allowed Davis to mount and finish Nunes with blows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/11101320/image-204.png><p>On July 28, 2012, Nunes was slated to compete against Milana Dudieva at Invicta FC 2: Baszler vs. McMann. On July 9, Dudieva withdrew from the contest due to sickness, and Nunes was subsequently slated to go on Leslie Smith.</p><p>Smith also pulled out due to an injury, so Nunes ended up competing against Raquel Pa’aluhi. Due to a rear-naked choke in the opening round, Nunes was able to win the contest by technical submission.</p><p>At Invicta FC 4: Esparza vs. Hyatt on January 5, 2013, Nunes made a comeback to the organization to take on Sarah D’Alelio. Nunes was defeated by a score of unanimous decisions.</p><p>On August 3, 2013, in Brazil, at UFC 163, Nunes faced Sheila Gaff for the first time inside the octagon. In the first round, she obtained a TKO victory.</p><p>On November 6, 2013, Nunes competed in her second UFC match against Germaine de Randamie at UFC Fight Night 31. In the first round, she obtained a TKO victory.</p><p>At UFC 178 on September 27, 2014, Nunes squared off against Cat Zingano. In the first round, Zingano was almost knocked out with punches, but she lost that round before being defeated by TKO.</p><p>Following a three-fight winning streak, Nunes was given her first title opportunity in the UFC. On July 9, 2016, at UFC 200, she competed against Miesha Tate for the UFC Women’s Bantamweight Championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/11101322/image-203.png><p>Tate was initially taken aback by Nunes’ knees and punches, and in the first round, the fight was won by rear-naked choke submission. She became the first openly homosexual UFC champion thanks to her triumph.</p><p>In the main event of UFC 207 on December 30, 2016, Nunes successfully defended her championship against Ronda Rousey, who had recently returned to the sport. 48 seconds into the first round, punches from Nunes resulted in a TKO victory.</p><p>The coaches for The Ultimate Fighter 30 on ESPN+, which included heavyweight and women’s flyweight competitors, were revealed to be Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pea on February 5, 2022.</p><p>On June 10, 2023, UFC 289 was slated to feature a trilogy matchup vs Julianna Pea. Pea fractured his ribs during training camp, and it was revealed on May 2, 2023, that he would not be able to compete.</p><p>Irene Aldana consented to take Pea’s place at the function. During the post-fight interview, Nunes declared her retirement from active competition after winning the fight by a convincing unanimous decision.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Amanda Nunes have any children?</h2><p>Amanda Nunes and her spouse, Nina Nunes have a daughter together named Raegan Ann Nunes who was born on September 24, 2020.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqkmqaUlnqvwc2eqmabmJ65pb7Ep2SmnZWperOtxKCYp2WRo7tuutSnnKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./palencia-statue-restoration.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Botched Statue Restoration In Spanish City Of Palencia Has Locals Baffled">&larr;
