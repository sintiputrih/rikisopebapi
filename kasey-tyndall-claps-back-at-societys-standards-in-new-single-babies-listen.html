And sometimes&nbsp;the devil likes to get under my skin about it so the song is kind of my response to the&nbsp;devil,” she told <strong>Celeb Secrets Country</strong> in an exclusive interview. “It’s one of my favorite releases to date.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kasey-Tyndall-.jpeg><p>Just yesterday (June 24), the country rocker dropped a powerful visual for the honest track that you can watch below. Using a dollhouse to show the different visions of her life, one with a husband and kids and the other as an artist, Tyndall burns the dollhouse to the ground and the guilt she carried in choosing her own independent path in the end.</p><p>“I wanted to find a way to showcase all of the ‘expectations’ of someone my age,” <span class=il>Tyndall</span> shared in a statement. “So we came up with the dollhouse, which was inspired by ‘13 Going On 30.’ Each room showcased a different expectation and Emma Golden brought it to life in the magical way that she does… and of course I had to set it on fire!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fest22-thursday-dsj-_DSC2169-scaled.jpg><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country</strong> was able to catch up with Kasey during the <a href=#><strong>2022 CMA Music Festival</strong></a>&nbsp;in Nashville earlier this month, where she performed at the Spotlight Stage for first time. She talks about her festival debut, “Babies,” touring with <a href=#><strong>Drake White</strong></a>, and what she hopes to accomplish this year.</p><p>Let us know if you’re loving “Babies” by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sending us a tweet at <a href=#>@CS_Country</a>.</p><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country: Your single “Babies” is finally here! Can you talk about like the&nbsp;writing process with that song?</strong></p><p><strong>Kasey Tyndall:</strong>&nbsp;“So&nbsp;I wrote it with <strong>Smith Anhquist</strong> and <strong>Gary Garris</strong>. My little sister is 23, I’m 26, and she&nbsp;just had her first baby while my&nbsp;friends are getting married and having kids, and I’m just not on the same timeline. And sometimes&nbsp;the devil likes to get under my skin about it so the song is kind of my response to the&nbsp;devil.”</p><p><strong>CSC: Your previous single “Jesus and Joan Jett” is similar with a sinner vs saint </strong><strong>concept. Can you talk more about that one?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“<strong>Joan Jett</strong> is one of my heroes and I learned that asking myself two questions could get me&nbsp;through anything in life. And one is what would Jesus do? And one is what would Joan Jett do? Add it all together and you get your answer.”</p><p><strong>CSC: Are these songs going to end up on an EP or an album?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“We’re taking baby steps right now. I just&nbsp;know that we have a few more songs coming out this year and, and see where that takes us.”</p><p><strong>CSC: You just finished a 20-stop tour with Drake White. Can you talk about your</strong><br><strong>favorite tour experiences with him?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“Drake’s such an incredible person and his story is incredible. Every time I’m around<br>him and his team, my life is just better. I don’t know what it is about them&nbsp;but their lights shines so bright. I felt like I walked away with a bunch of&nbsp;brothers. All of his fans embraced me&nbsp;and followed me and so I’m super thankful for Drake and his camp and&nbsp;I’m sure we’re going to do some more shows in the future.”</p><p><strong>CSC: From like a musical standpoint, what’s something you learned from Drake while touring</strong><br><strong>with him?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“Positivity. Just never&nbsp;giving up. His attitude is just so incredible. And like I said, every time I&nbsp;walked away from him, until I saw them again, I just&nbsp;felt like my life had just been rejuvenated. Just so much positivity.”</p><p><strong>CSC: What are your summer and fall touring plans?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“Well, it’s festival season right now, so we’re just kind of popping around. I do have some random shows&nbsp;with Drake kind of sprinkled in there but just kind of waiting to see&nbsp;what happens in the fall and see what kind of touring opportunities come along. But I’ll definitely&nbsp;be doing my own stuff.”</p><p><strong>CSC: You have a very country rock style. What artists do you draw inspiration from?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“Growing, up I listened to a lot of <strong>Avril Lavigne</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Miranda Lambert</strong>, obviously she’s got<br>that rock edge too. I listened to <strong>Joan Jett</strong>&nbsp;but I also listen to&nbsp;<strong>Brantley Gilbert</strong> and <strong>Alison Krauss.&nbsp;</strong>So it kinda meets in the&nbsp;middle I guess.”</p><p><strong>CSC: Can you talk a little about your background and&nbsp;how you got into music?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“I’m originally from Greenville, NC and I was going to school to be a&nbsp;nurse, that was always my realistic passion. I always wanted to&nbsp;be an artist but I kind of figured everyone wants to be an artist and I didn’t know how to get out of eastern North Carolina. I ended up winning a contest to sing with<strong>&nbsp;Keith Urban</strong> in Raleigh where we&nbsp;had to call into the local radio station and audition singing&nbsp;the Miranda part to the ‘We Were Us’&nbsp;song. So I got to go up and sing that in front of 20,000 people and one thing kinda led to another. I met my first&nbsp;manager, who happened to be there and that just kinda made it a reality.”</p><p><strong>CSC: Since we’re Celeb Secrets, can you tell us like a behind the&nbsp;scenes secret with your single ‘Babies’ that fans wouldn’t know just by listening to the&nbsp;song?</strong></p><p><strong>KT:</strong>&nbsp;“Oh man. I’m such an open book.&nbsp;I wrote it last August. &nbsp;That’s what people don’t know. I was in Nashville at Gary’s house. He has a studio and he does a lot of production.&nbsp;The only thing thing I can really drink before I go on stage is a vodka Red Bull. If I want a drink at all before I play, that’s the only thing&nbsp;I can drink because I feel like everything else kind of makes you a little tired and I’ll forget&nbsp;lyrics, but the Red Bull keeps you up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKOYvLa606uwZ5ufonxzfJFrZmluX2eCcLfArJyyZaSuu6Wty6VknKSRpcBursCcomaZpGLAsK%2FInquyq12owaK6w5qpnatdnrtuusSwZKyhnpy5pnnBmpminaNiuaq%2F056laA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./noah-gragson-net-worth-226290.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Noah Gragson Net Worth 2024">&larr;
