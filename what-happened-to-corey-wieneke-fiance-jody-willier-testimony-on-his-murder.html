On October 13, 1992, Jody Hotz, Wieneke's fiance, dialed 911 and informed them of his death.</p><p>After arriving home from work on that fateful Tuesday, Jody found Cory "all bleeding, and not breathing, and cold." He was meant to be in the pub, but instead, he was lying on the floor of the couple's shared bedroom due to deadly blunt force damage to the body.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Loved ones remember Corey Wieneke <a href=#>#Dateline</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p4K8o3WhBS</a></p>— Dateline NBC (@DatelineNBC) <a href=#>June 19, 2022</a><p>When the rescuers arrived at his house, they discovered his body on a blood-flooded floor in his room. With a single glance, one could tell he died as a result of blunt stress and beating.</p><p>When they asked Jody where she was, she answered she was at work. She was ruled out as a suspect after obtaining an alibi from her coworkers.</p><p>The police initially suspected theft or a home invasion, but quickly dismissed the possibility. The following morning, one of several reporters reported seeing a bloodied aluminum baseball bat on the motorway close by, which turned out to be a murder weapon.</p><p>Investigators discovered their way to Annette Cahill through investigation. According to one of Wieneke's coworkers, she caught up with Corey on the morning of October 13 (around the time the pub was closing) and even had a disagreement with him.</p><p>But, before officials could summon Annette for questioning, she showed up at the police station and informed them that she and Wieneke were in a casual relationship.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A 2019 jury trial found Annette Cahill responsible for the 1992 bludgeoning death of her former boyfriend Corey Lee Wieneke. <a href=#>https://t.co/m0CaRK3dXq</a></p>— WQAD (@wqad) <a href=#>March 28, 2022</a><p>She was upset that morning since they had planned to hook up, but she saw him with another female coworker, making her envious.</p><p>But she said that they subsequently reconciled and even hooked up.

As a result, his death remained a cold case until 2017, when Jessica Becker came forward with a traumatic childhood recollection(<a href=# rel=noopener>Talks </a>Today).</p><p><strong>More On:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Abercrombie And Fitch Ceo Fired For Fat Shaming - What Were Mike Jeffries Comments?</a></p><h2 id=fiance-jody-williers-test>Fiance Jody Willier's Testimony On Corey Wieneke's Murder</h2><p>Fiance Jody Willier testified in March 2019 that her boyfriend, Corey Wieneke, was "a lot of fun to be around." She indicated that she was aware that he was having relationships with other women, but she still loved him.</p><p>"I overlooked a lot of stuff, and absorbed a lot of that," she said of Wieneke's affairs, according to The Muscatine Journal.</p><p>Annette Cahill, one of Wieneke's girlfriends, is charged with first-degree murder in his death in October 1992. She was arrested after a witness claimed she overheard Cahill confessing to killing Wieneke, a bartender, shortly after his death.</p><p>The recollection was subsequently revealed to be from an unknown lady who was nine years old at the time of Wieneke's murder. It is thought to comprise the majority of the prosecution's case.</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>Jessica Becker, now 36, allegedly told police that when she was nine, she went to play at Cahill's niece's home, in 1992. She says she can remember seeing Cahill pacing around, lighting candles, and making incriminating statements about murdering Wieneke.&nbsp;</p><p>"Corey, I'm sorry for murdering you," Becker told the jury she overheard Cahill remark in a dark room of Cahill's home as Becker was spending the night with friends.</p><p>Cahill's attorneys had refuted the claims, insisting they're based on animosity rather than truth. Furthermore, the defense said that the confession was not real since it was overheard by a youngster who was not being examined by a qualified professional at the time.</p><p>According to the Muscatine Journal, a judge declared a mistrial in 2019 after a jury of five women and seven men could not find any physical evidence on her behalf.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Iowa Supreme Court has upheld the second-degree murder conviction of Annette Dee Cahill, whom a Muscatine County jury found guilty in the beating death of 22-year-old Corey Wieneke on Oct. 13, 1992. <a href=#>https://t.co/wFoEruRKQZ</a></p>— Quad-City Times (@qctimes) <a href=#>March 26, 2022</a><p>After the lawsuit was over, Cahill relocated to Tipton, remarried, and had another child and grandkids.</p><p>However, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Cinemaholic</a>, in September 2019, she was convicted guilty of second-degree murder for the second time. As a result, she was sentenced to 50 years in prison, with the possibility of release after 35 years, a conviction and term that the Iowa Supreme Court upheld in March 2022.</p><h2 id=where-is-corey-wieneke-ki>Where Is Corey Wieneke Killer Annette Cahill Now?</h2><p>Corey Wieneke Killer Annette Cahill was found guilty of second-degree murder more than 25 years later.</p><p>After six days of hearing testimony and arguments in court, a jury of nine women and three men began deliberations to find Cahill, now 56, guilty of his murder.</p><p>Cahill was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in May of 2018. Cahill, 29, and Wieneke, 22, had a loving and intimate connection for approximately a year before Wieneke's death, according to the prosecution, led by Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren.</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>Scott Payne, a guy who knew Cahill in 1992 and said he saw her burn "blood-stained" items in a fire barrel at the residence where she was residing, testified before the jury.</p><p>His father, Jim stated that the jurors had a difficult job and that he wished the trial would be ended for the benefit of everyone.
