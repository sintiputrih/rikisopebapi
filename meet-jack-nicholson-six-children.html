The couple, who were co-stars on were together from 1962 til 1968.</p><p id=e1q5K-ebIzA data-wc=44>Jennifer was born September 13, 1963 and mostly grew up in Hawaii with her mom. The 60-year-old told<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Los Angeles Times</a> that she likes "being Jack Nicholson's daughter and I'm proud of him, but people don't understand the pressures that come along with that."</p><p id=exCqEozL3wL data-wc=33>The star took after her father in becoming an actor, appearing in movies throughout the 90s. But she's also worked as a movie set designer, an interior designer, and also a fashion designer.</p><p id=e_Ou6HR3pmu data-wc=20>The designer married Mark Norfleet from 1997 to 2003, and in that time they had two sons; Sean and Duke.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Caleb Goddard, 53</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c034da11c4c-gettyimages-517211638.jpg><p id=eCG-uHd8WMo data-wc=63>Caleb was born in September 26, 1970 to Susan Anspach, who starred opposite the actor in . While Susan publicly contended that Jack was the father of Caleb, the actor claimed he wasn't convinced. Susan went on to marry actor Mark Goddard, who adopted Caleb, but the son went on to insist in 1996 that Jack had privately recognized his paternity.</p><p id=eF38fNzzpu1 data-wc=49>In 1998, Jack confirmed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Rolling Stone</a> that he and Caleb were "getting along beautifully now", before caveating that "based on the legality - the extremely unpleasant litigious nature of most of my relationship there - I’m not really at liberty to say what I think about it."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Honey Hollman, 43</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0298981957f5-gettyimages-159142931.jpg><p id=eRwhkZSiyY4 data-wc=31>In the midst of Jack's 17-year relationship with Anjelica Huston, the actor reportedly had a relationship with Danish model Winnie Hollman, who gave birth to daughter Honey on January 26, 1982.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKoXn-epcSv data-wc=23>Jack has never publicly recognized Honey as his own, and not much is known about her as Winnie raised her back in Denmark.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Lorraine Nicholson, 33</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ace82aaa454-gettyimages-99983960.jpg><p id=eZvCxC1KOae data-wc=33>Lorraine is Jack's daughter from his relationship with actress Rebecca Broussard, born April 16, 1990. The duo have maintained a close relationship, with Jack even attending a college tour with "the fabulous Lorraine".</p><p id=e2cUHITQZpKp data-wc=37>Jack told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> of the moment: "With families, you don't always get to be one-on-one. [And sometimes] there's this wall of 'What happened today, darling? Anything interesting?' I've asked more unanswered questions to these two particular children."</p><p id=e0Ej1S3lxd5u data-wc=73>He added: "Then you think, 'Hey, I did not want to hang out with my parents when I was a teenager.' You have to get over that as a parent. What I don't want to pass along is my irrational fears. They can be perfect kids, they can try to do everything right — and you're in the lap of the gods. This is the eternal vulnerability that you have with your children."</p><p id=e0LH0y4EyEiM data-wc=30>Lorrain went on to attend Brown University and has since pursued a career in film, with her directorial debut, short film , debuting at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Ray Nicholson, 32</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6e8e18f3ff1-gettyimages-1254337087.jpg><p id=eNgc0xtEGWU5 data-wc=39><a class=hm-link href=#>Jack's youngest son, Ray</a>, was born to Rebecca on February 20, 1992. He has perhaps followed in his father's footsteps the most closely, with a serious acting career as he has appeared in Promising Young Woman and Licorice Pizza.</p><p id=eiXSLhZPyVmS data-wc=45>Jack described a teenage Ray as "fab", adding: "Ray might not tell you exactly what he's up to, but once he's got his mind set on something, he's gonna stick to it and take care of business, no matter what me or anybody else says."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Tessa Gourin, 29</h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e19wPbj0FxON data-wc=23>In February 2023, Tessa Gourin wrote an essay in <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Newsweek</a>, announcing herself as Jack's "illegitimate" daughter from a relationship with waitress Jennine Gourin.&nbsp;</p><p id=eB4U0LkHV0rq data-wc=34>Born on August 15, 1994, Tessa described a childhood without her father, as they "never had a relationship", bar meeting "on the odd occasion as a young girl (at the behest of my mother)."</p><p id=efyk1kZa20PX data-wc=74>She wrote: "I don't hide the fact that Jack Nicholson is my biological father. Why should I? However, it is also not something I've ever led with in a conversation. So many people have been forced to live with the pain of a parent's absence, famous or not. But it makes it that much harder when that absent parent is actively in the lives of their other children, which is the case for me."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
