Though Jamie limits his personal life only to his social media, we did some research so that you can know more about his wife in this article.</span></p><p>From age to job, to her family members, all the details unfold as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Blue Frog Ranch: Meet Jeanette Dube, Jamie Dube Wife</strong></h3><p><a href=#>Jamie Dube</a>, the star of Blue Frog Ranch is currently married to his wife Jeanette Dube. Although they never divulged information on how long they have been married to each other, it is likely that they exchanged wedding vows a couple of decades before.</p><p>Throughout the years of their time together, the married couple has been very supportive of each other. In January 2022, Jeanette proudly shared of her husband making it in as the cast member of Blind Frog Ranch.</p><p>Jeanette proclaimed on her Facebook, “So proud of my husband, Jamie Dube, the newest cast member of “Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch.” The season premiere is tonight at 10 pm on Discovery Channel. Jamie – you have worked so hard for this and made many sacrifices along the way. I never doubted for a minute that you would achieve your goal. It’s just who you are!! I am so incredibly proud of you!”</p><p>But, Jamie’s success isn’t only his and his wife’s to share. The happily married couple are parents to two children; a son named Brady Dube and a daughter named Bryanna Dube.</p><p>On National Son’s Day Jeanette took to her Facebook and posted, “On National Son’s Day… Brady, I am so proud of you! You bring me so much joy and I love you so much!! Thanks for being you!!” Jamie seconded his wife’s sentiment in the post by adding in the comment section, “Brady I must say you raised the bar. I couldn’t be more proud of you ♡ <span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">.”</span></p><p>Brady is currently based in Orrington, Maine, and has graduated from high school.</p><p>As for their daughter, the oldest of the two, Bryanna worked at <span class=xt0psk2>Coach House Restaurant.

He was born in Howland, Maine, and has a twin sister Julie Casburn and a brother Mark Dube.</p><p>Proud of his Discovery stint, Jamie’s twin had also taken to her Facebook to appreciate him “I am so proud of my twin!!!! Jamie started his journey many years ago and look at him now…he’s on The Discovery Channel. Check him out tonight at 10:00 p.m. on Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch. Again, so so proud of you Jamie! ”</p><p>Meanwhile, his brother has been a jeweler and working in the sales of Diamond & Gold Mine Outlet & Local Coupon Outlet for the past 18 years. So, it’s true that he and Jamie had collaborated in a jewelry business that they called Mark Jamie Dube.</p><p>Jamie Dube joins <a href=#>Duane</a>, his son Chad, who is the head of ranch security Charlie Snider, and world-renowned geologist Eric Drummond, in their quest for Aztec gold.</p><p>Like everyone on the team, Jamie is also convinced that other than the Lost Rhodes Mines Gold there is some big paranormal activity hidden inside the caverns of the Utah Mountains.</p><p>(Of course) this is not the first time Jamie is out hunting and investigating the paranormal.</p><p>A former police officer-turned-real estate agent, he founded East Coast Ghost Trackers sometime ago. East Coast, if you should know, is a group that has led guided ghost tours at Fort Knox (a Maine resource guide company) for years.</p><p>Confident there will be spirits at night, he and Ken Ort had founded the company.</p><p>Around that time, Jamie also published a book, “Where Do You Walk?” penned about getting into ghost-hunting, entities at Fort Knox, and some of the families he said the team has helped. One could also find the book on Amazon.</p><h3><strong>Jeanette Dube Age</strong></h3><p>In February 2023, Jeanette Dube turned 49 years old.
