Guardiola <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/herizen-guardiola>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I’m a musician – I wasn’t acting before – but that was my first break pretty much."</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, "Dare Me"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://vmagazine.com/article/herizen-guardiola-get-down-interview/> was also canceled </a>by USA Network in April 2020, but Guardiola is sure to find her dance-card full as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic ends, and the entertainment industry gets back into gear.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A FAMILY GIFT</strong></p><p class=dh>Guardiola <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/jho1pelOrT4>inherited her musicality</a> from her father, a reggae musician, whose artistic name is Johnny Dread, and his influence led her to participate in several musical projects, including Jonathan Visger's Absofacto. Guardiola's vocals were featured in the song "Done With Love" from his "ThousandPeaces" EP.</p><p class=dh>Guardiola was born in Miami, to Juan Carlos, who is of Cuban descent, and Venice Pink, a Jamaica-born yoga instructor who homeschooled her daughter. Guardiola said <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/9635/herizen-guardiola-on-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel>proudly</a>:</p><p class=dh>“We are Caribbean, we have that spice. This is me—take it or leave it.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BORN TO THE MUSIC</strong></p><p class=dh>Her father taught her to play the guitar from a young age, and her childhood was spent in close proximity to the late legendary Bob Marley's family. But if her dad's legacy to Guardiola was music, her mom's was a passion for wellness.</p><p class=dh>Like her mother, Guardiola is a vegetarian, and very particular about the kind of food she eats. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vogue.com/article/the-get-down-netflix-herizen-guardiola-disco-glamour-natural-hair>opened up</a> about her health regime:</p><p class=dh>"I’m a vegetarian; I eat a lot of organic food. I do a lot of stretching and yoga, and I go on hikes—anywhere that is pretty."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NEW PROJECT "TROUBLEMAKER"</strong></p><p class=dh>Guardiola revealed that she was inspired by a real-life event, which saw her and a friend detained. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2020/03/06/premiere-herizen-troublemaker/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I didn’t do anything to harm anyone or myself, and on my part it was all a big misunderstanding so I was let go!"</p><p class=dh>Things were a little more serious for her friend, who actually got to spent the night in jail. Guardiola <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2020/03/06/premiere-herizen-troublemaker/>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My friend had to spend the night in jail (he was fine and out the next day) but it gave me the inspiration to write this song and I wrote it that same night."</p><p class=dh>The result is a great song, with a catchy beat, sizzling vocals, and provocative lyrics. The song is playful and tips a passing nod to hip hop and sonic music. Guardiola shot a video with a sassy skater theme, which is gathering fans on YouTube.</p><p class=dh>"Dare Me" fans are still hopeful that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1264067/Dare-Me-season-2-Netflix-release-date-renewed-cancelled-another-series-USA-Network>the network will reconsider the cancellation</a> of Season 2, since the series was critically acclaimed, and the international broadcasting of the series only started on Netflix on March 20, 2020.</p><p class=dh>The last episode of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenrant.com/dare-me-everything-fans-need-know-before-watching-show-cheerleaders-murder/>the first season of "Dare Me" </a>ended with a hair-raising cliff-hanger which has left fans desperate for closure, so there is still hope the series will be back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtoam9ha3qpsdGisZ6mXZzCor7DoqalmV2ewG6ty6ymZpldnLanwMSdZKyhnpyyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaleena-bliss-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaleena Bliss Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
