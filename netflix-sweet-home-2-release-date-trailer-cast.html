The trailer opens with an unexpected outbreak of massive monsterization that has put the world into a collapse. Living with the grim reality that anybody could turn into a monster at any time, fellow humans grow suspicious of one another for fear of being infected.</p><p><a href=#>Continuing from the aftermath of Sweet Home Season 1</a>, residents of the Green Home managed to run for their lives and seek refuge in the stadium, which serves as a new settlement for survivors. While the first season sees the Green Home survivors fending off these monsters by themselves, the new season introduces The Crow Platoon, a military unit specializing in handling monsters and in charge of protecting the new settlement. As for Hyun-soo, sick and tired of shape-shifting between human and monster, dives straight to the Bamseom Emergency Bureau, hoping for some vaccine that could put an end to his half-human, half-monster situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although we can expect a couple of upgraded monsters, Sweet Home 2 brings into question who the real monster is. After all, desires, controlled by fear and mistrust, are just as horrible, if not worse, than the blood-thirsty monsters preying on human beings. The upcoming season also digs deeper into the complex interests of the survivors, ultimately putting them into further conflict and dividing them. At the end of the day, Sweet Home 2 is a portrayal of just how fragile human nature is, especially when their lives are at stake.</p><h2 id=who-stars-in-lsquo-sweet-home-2-rsquo>Who Stars in ‘Sweet Home 2’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sweet-Home-(2020).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Song Kang</strong> returns as Cha Hyun-soo, a troubled high school student who originally moved into 1410 in Green Home after a tragic car accident killed his family. Initially reclusive, Hyun-soo finds himself trapped in the middle of a monster-ridden apocalypse and is soon infected by one himself. Gaining superpowers, Hyun-soo uses them to protect fellow Green Home residents and lead them to safety. However the question looms: are his newfound strengths an asset or a liability?</p><p>Joining the cast lineup is <strong>Lee Jin-wook </strong>as Pyeon Sang-wook, a mysterious man often mistaken for a gangster.

Confronted by a voice indicating that Hyun-soo’s arrival is expected, the lead protagonist asks what he needs to do. As survivors grapple with the constant threat of monsterization and monster groups, can Hyun-soo be trusted to protect everyone from the madness, or is he part of this harrowing nightmare instead?</p><p>Having escaped the confines of the Green Home, survivors now find themselves stranded in a run-down baseball stadium, which serves as the primary backdrop for the events of Season 2. Amidst the ruins of the area, survivors have united to build their own little community. However, conflicts arise leaving everyone to stay guarded on their feet. Not only do they have to battle the external monsters that threaten their lives, but also the inner demons of their desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Derived from the immensely popular webtoon of the same title, Sweet Home made its global debut on Netflix in December 2020.
