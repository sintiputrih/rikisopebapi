According to the businessman, who won the show in 2005, the Republican presidential candidate, 70, made sexist remarks during filming.</p><p>Pinkett tells <i>Us </i>that he heard Trump frequently comment on women’s looks behind the scenes and would talk about which female contestants he’d like to sleep with.</p><p>“What I witnessed firsthand was Donald commenting on a woman’s attractiveness, how he thought she was beautiful and how he’d like to sleep with her,” the reality TV vet says.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/randal-pinkett-tara-dowdell-kwame-jackson-c7c49802-e6c0-42d4-8fac-4ab1079e5b22.jpg><p>He continues, “He was expressing an interest or kind of saying, ‘Isn’t she beautiful? I’d love to sleep with her.’”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Pinkett’s claims come just a week after <a href=#>an incriminating 2005 <i>Access Hollywood</i> video</a> featuring Trump making misogynistic remarks about women was leaked to <i><a href=#>The Washington Post</a></i> on Friday, October 7. In the controversial clip, the Oval Office hopeful brags about kissing and groping women and even says his star power affords him the opportunity to grab women by their genitals without permission.</p><p>Additionally, several women — including former Miss Utah <b>Temple Taggart McDowell</b> and <i>People</i> magazine writer <b>Natasha Stoynoff </b>— <a href=#>have accused the real estate tycoon of touching them inappropriately</a>. Recently revisited interviews have also proven that Trump has made <a href=#>offensive comments about a slew of famous females, including&nbsp;<b>Lindsay Lohan</b></a><b></b>, <b>Paris Hilton</b> and even his own daughter <b>Ivanka</b>.</p><p>After catching wind of Trump’s headline-making remarks, Pinkett — who is now the chairman and CEO of business consulting firm BCT Partners — tells <i>Us </i>that he was disgusted, but not surprised.</p><p>“The part that was new and was appalling was the bragging about [being] sexually aggressive and allegedly … behavior that represents sexual assault when he talked about unwanted advances and grabbing women and what he can do as a celebrity and that women would just let him do it, which was appalling,” he says. “That was far beyond the behavior that I’ve witnessed on <i>The Apprentice</i>, and even worse, from the standpoint that it borderlines on — no, it doesn’t borderline on — it would be criminal behavior.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donald-trump-billy-bush-arianne-zucker-5f38ff54-3d2e-4624-9ecf-0acc55d9b16f.jpg><p>Aside from Trump’s abhorrent language directed at women, Pinkett also told <i>Us</i> why he believes the real estate mogul is “absolutely” a racist. As <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> previously reported, Pinkett was asked to share his winning title with his runner-up, <b>Rebecca Jarvis</b>, a white woman.</p><p>“I’m the only person of color to ever win on the show. And I’m the only one who after Donald hired me was asked to share the title with the runner-up,” the Rutgers alum — who “flatly refused” to share his title with Jarvis — recounts. “It was insulting for him to ask me the question. I believe it was racially motivated that he did not want an African American to be the clear and decisive winner. … For Donald to suggest that I share the title, again, was insulting, and I believe it was racially driven.”</p><p>During <a href=#>a 2011 interview with <i>THR</i></a><i></i>, Trump insisted that he is not racist and even brought up the fact that he chose Pinkett as the winner of season 4 to drive his point home.&nbsp;</p><p>“When it comes to racism and racists, I am the least racist person there is. And I think most people that know me would tell you that. I am the least racist. I’ve had great relationships,” he said at the time. “In fact, Randal Pinkett won on <i>The Apprentice</i> a little while ago, a couple years ago, and Randal’s been outstanding in every way. So I am the least racist person.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Given his experience on <i>The Apprentice</i> — and working for the Trump organization for an entire year after winning show — Pinkett believes that the billionaire (who was fired from NBC in 2015 after making upsetting remarks about Mexican immigrants) is not fit to serve as the country’s next POTUS.</p><p>“I think Donald would make for a divisive president that would divide our country, not unite our country, at a time when we need greater unity,” he explains to <i>Us</i>. “And so I don’t see Donald as being the leader our country could ever need to represent Muslims, or to represent immigrants, or to represent women, or to represent people of color, or to represent veterans, and the list goes on.”</p><p>Pinkett concludes, “My opinion is that Donald is out of touch with the needs of the American people, and to the contrary, Donald would serve as a wedge between the American people, and in fact, he’s already done that in his campaign. And a president is also a role model for young boys and girls; his behavior is reprehensible, and putting aside his policies, as a role model, as a figurehead for our country, Donald would be an embarrassment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqKCnsq%2FAyJycZq%2BZo7umvoytqa6loGLEorrTnptmq5Wteri106FksKedmrtur86nq56rpJa7tb%2BMsGttbWBrf3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rutina-wesley-boyfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rutina Wesley: Boyfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements">&larr;
