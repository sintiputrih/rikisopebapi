The couple then seemed to enjoy a low-key dinner date at the celebrity hotspot.&nbsp;Tiffany was dressed for her dinner date in a mustard yellow sweater, tattered blue jeans, and bright shoes. She also wore a white face mask and walked into the restaurant with a blue Fendi handbag. Her phone was tied around her with a lengthy strap.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Stallionaires-Pooch-1.jpg alt="Stallionaires Pooch" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Stallionaires Pooch, on the other hand, was dressed in a bright blue jacket that covered a black T-shirt with his name inscribed in white graphics. He also wore blue jeans, and despite their best efforts to keep their relationship private, the media ruined their plans.&nbsp;During the early phases of the COVID-19 epidemic, Haddish and rapper Common started dating in mid-2020. The former also characterized her relationship with the rapper as the finest she had ever been in.</p><p></p><p>Tiffany declared her breakup in November 2021 after a year of dating. Common said on the Hollywood Unlocked Uncensored with Jason Lee podcast that it was difficult for him to manage everything while still feeding the relationship.
