Rather than joining her graduating class, she decides to take a trip to Mexico City to visit her relatives.</p><p>But considering how big Miranda’s part was in the show, fans know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this excuse was written into the plot to cover up the fact that Lalaine was not available for filming</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-was-lalaine>Where Was Lalaine?</h2><p>According to Screen Rant, Lalaine missed out on several episodes of the last season, as well as the movie, because she had left the show to pursue her music career. She was doing tours with Radio Disney and, in 2003, released her debut album ‘Inside Story.’</p><p>The actress and singer wrote six songs on the album and traveled around Southern California and Hawaii in support of it.</p><p>Later in 2005, Lalaine appeared on the last episode of the TV show All That.

In 2007, she was arrested for felony possession of methamphetamine.</p><p>Luckily, Lalaine was able to enter a drug treatment program and regain control of her life. The charge was expunged and Lalaine then stepped out of the spotlight for the most part.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilary Duff Nearly Blew Her 'Lizzie McGuire' Audition</a></span></p><p>She did appear in a few small acting roles over the years, including as the Gossipy Girl in Easy A in 2010.
