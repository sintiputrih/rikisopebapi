However, her birthday soon turned into anything but an awe-inspiring festivity when a new girl joined the ranks in paradise, and immediately asked Tanner out on a date.</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>The shock, the horror…er…maybe not.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Hear me out; I know how it feels to have your birthday ruined by the guy you thought was your knight in shining armor&nbsp;— it’s certainly something that stays with you, but did Tanner really drop the ball here? Did he deserve to be spoken about behind his back all afternoon? Is this just how life unfolds in paradise, or is production to blame?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bachelor in Paradise (@bachelorinparadise)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>I mean, even their Instagram mentions a “birthday curse” nine years in the making, and Kat is no stranger to Bachelor Nation shenanigans. Should she have been better-prepared for whatever the Bachelor Nation powers that be had in store? Might she have had a better afternoon if she took a moment to self-reflect, instead of immediately jumping into bashing Tanner? Regardless, her birthday ended up being quite a lackluster day.</p><p data-characters=33 data-current-count=33 data-injectable=false>Let’s take it from the top!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-on-kat-s-birthday data-injectable=false>What happened on Kat’s birthday?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kat Izzo (@katizzzo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Kat woke up, as we said above, expecting a stellar birthday and maybe even a date card that would lead to a special romantic afternoon with Tanner. There is a date card given out on Kat’s birthday, and Tanner does get to go, but Kat isn’t the leading lady in this fairytale. Instead, Bachelor in Paradise brings in a bombshell in the form of Davia Esther, from Zach’s season.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Her hands hold the coveted date card, and she’s got her beautiful eyes set on one man: Tanner. As she goes down to the beach, she immediately pulls Tanner for a conversation, and she quickly realizes that he’s a pretty great dude (because, of course, she does); not wanting to talk to anyone else after their chat, she asks him on a date, and he says yes.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Just as soon as Tanner says yes, he tells Davia that he needs to pull Kat aside for a conversation first, and this is where things go off the rails. If you remember correctly, Kat and Brayden Bowers had partnered up when Tanner first got to the beach, and after he had a moment to speak to a couple of the women, Tanner pulled Kat for a date, and she said yes immediately.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Kat took Tanner’s hand, and the two walked off into the sunset together. She didn’t ask Brayden to talk at all, didn’t give him a moment to explain why she said yes so fast it made our heads spin — she simply skipped off onto an exciting new date.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Tanner asking Kat to talk before their date was more kindness than she showed to Brayden in a similar moment, but instead of taking a beat to rationalize that idea, she flew into outrage, which is where she spent her birthday; emotionally charged and angry.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Tanner, on the other hand, took the time to talk to Kat about going on a date, and was having the time of his life; enjoying a lovely conversation with Davia, dancing, and sharing some romantic moments, and we can’t say he’s wrong for that. People go to paradise for the opportunity to meet “the one,” which doesn’t mean settling down with the first person they talk to.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>Also, as we just said, Tanner and Kat weren’t betrothed to one another from day one. Tanner came in and asked Kat on a date when she’d already paired up with Brayden and — say what you will about our favorite guy with golden retriever energy and earrings we find appealing and want to steal — but his feelings were hurt as he felt played by Kat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Is Tanner wrong for going on a date?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bachelor in Paradise (@bachelorinparadise)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Just look at this stunner; if you ask us, Tanner can do no wrong, but let’s examine this one for a second. Many people on the beach, in seeing Kat’s reaction to Tanner being asked out by Davia, used the word “karma,” and we can’t say they’re wrong for that, either.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Karma, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">by definition</a>, is “the sum of a person’s actions in this and previous states of existence, viewed as deciding their fate in future existences,” and people thought that this was the state of karma visiting her after what she’d done to Brayden. Her being upset with Tanner for going on a date doesn’t sit right with us, after that being the very method by which she and Tanner got together in the first place.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>It also doesn’t sit right with us, given the extra kindness Tanner offered to Kat, a puzzle piece she glossed over regarding Brayden, or rather, dis-regarding him completely. It also doesn’t bode well with us that she navigated through the rest of her day with anger and upset, so that when Tanner returned and asked to speak to her, she was ready to unleash on him instead of going into the conversation with a clear mind.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Also, if I may bring it up again, she did worse to Brayden. Now, I’m not in the business of getting even, but I just want justice for Brayden, okay? It’s clear that he ended up in greener pastures with his budding romance with Rachel, but Kat seemed pretty flippant about his emotions when she took a quick turn off of Brayden Ave onto Tanner Blvd; it’s the same way she’s dismissive of Tanner’s feelings, now.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Kat is a pretty girl, she’s funny, and she has excellent qualities, but when it comes to dating and being responsible for her emotions and the emotions of those she engages with, well, let’s just say we’re on Team Tanner (and Brayden) here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9aaqmaskaO7pr6MoqVmrJiaerO1xqGrZqyfYrGiwMRmmKenpJ2ys3nWqKSapl2ku263wK2qZpqZp8GpsMCyZK2glWKvoq%2FHnqOoql2eu268wKuYnaGjmnqtu9WeZK2qmZa7qLjEZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pattisalt92.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anne Of DENMARK (1) : Family tree by Patricia SALTER (pattisalt92)">&larr;
