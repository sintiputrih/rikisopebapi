The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Bay Packers </a>quarterback has already moved on from Shailene Woodley, who just last year the QB was ready to marry and settle down. He even said he is looking forward to having children with her. However, as we have seen with Aaron Rodgers, nothing makes sense or it is all very confusing. The quarterback has a new girlfriend who appears to be as bizarre as he is.</p><p>Rodgers is dating Blu of Earth, at least that is what she calls herself as she is in tune with nature and medicine. A tipster has told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Awesemo Side Action</a> that Blue of Earth changed her name from Charlotte Brereton to her new ultra-hip Instagram moniker and that Ms. Earth describes herself to be a ‘witch‘ and a ‘medicine woman.‘ She could be the same medicine woman who immunized Aaron Rodgers but we cannot confirm that.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Throwing like he’s h</a></strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ungover from partying with Brady after The Match”: NFL Twitter reacts to the Packers QB attending the minicamp</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aaron-rodgers-last-relationship-failed-because-of-his-hectic-nfl-schedule>Aaron Rodgers last relationship failed because of his hectic NFL schedule</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Adobe_Express_20220609_1706480-1024x576.jpg><p>Rodgers’ last relationship ended due to him not being able to devote enough time to his significant other during the 2021 NFL Season. As per Aaron’s newest girlfriend’s Linkedin profile, she has experience working in events such as the MTV Movie Awards, the Academy Awards, and the Grammys as well. She is a graduate of Florida Southern College.</p><p>On the 18th of April, Blu posted a picture of her and Aaron on her Instagram with a poem that she wrote for him, the poem spoke about her feelings on life ever since Aaron was a part of it.</p><p>“The Winds of change are upon us, do you feel it? On an individual level and a collective level. During times of great change-surrender, stillness and softening is our greatest ally… See you on the other side family. Thank you for being on this journey of life with me. I love you -Blu,” she wrote on Instagram</p><p>In another Instagram post after a month, she wrote, “This is my first post since submerging from the darkness <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@skycaveretreats</a>. A part of me died in the darkness. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. Sky Cave Retreats is an “off-grid, Earth-sheltered cabin that offers solo dark retreats in private.”</p><p>She is one of those persons who love to get in touch with nature and goes to great lengths in order to get in touch with a different realm. Rodgers would have loved it too, no outside talk, no internet, no phones, just a peaceful time with your loved one. To an NFL player, that sounds like a dream.</p><p>Since Blu has also claimed that she is a witch of sorts, will she be able to work her magic on Aaron Rodgers and finally remove the curse of not returning to the Super Bowl? Only time will tell… <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You can check out Blu’s official Instagram profile is there.</a></p><p><strong>Also read:</strong><a href=#>&nbsp;<strong>“I’ll represent a 7 jersey in the stands”: Rob Gronkowski drops a major hint at his participation in the next NFL season</strong></a></p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Revenge”: Cowboys DE DeMarcus Lawrence is itching to face the Buccaneers in Week 1</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBurcCrpqdloqSxqLHRrGSdmaSeu6h5waWsZqeWYrKivtOhZJplp57BpLSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-sheridan-bio-age-height-family-wife-yellowstone-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Sheridan Bio, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Yellowstone and Net Worth">&larr;
