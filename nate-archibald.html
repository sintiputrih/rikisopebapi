Early Life And Family</h2><p><strong>Shortly after Nathaniel “Tiny” Archibald</strong>, Nate Archibald was born in New York City, New York, to his parents, <strong>Julia Archibald</strong> and<strong> Big Tiny (nicknamed) Archibald</strong>.</p><p>He was the second son among six children and grew up in <strong>New York’s South Bronx</strong>. Within the glamour city of New York lies a place manifested with gangs, bullets, and violence.</p><p>The place gives rise to murders and drugs as if nothing happened, and the two-winged dreams get crushed into the ground. However, Nate could control it all, finding his escape in the basketball.</p><p>As he grew from a child to a teenager, he commenced shooting balls in the basket at a concrete, uneven playground. The determination that he carried from his teenage phase to school gets crushed one day.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>During his tenure in the DeWitt Clinton High School, he had only contributed one and a half-season for his school’s team until he was cut out.</p><p>Being a sophomore, he had to run with the junior teams, which gave birth to the idea of giving up. At that moment, his two mentors,<strong> Floyd Layne</strong> and <strong>Pablo Robertson,</strong>&nbsp;were the ones to show him the path of encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p>To illustrate, they were the former standout at Loyola of Chicago and Harlem. Thus, Archibald gave another chance at basketball and got reinstated on the squad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DeWitt-Clinton-High-School.jpg><p>In addition, the shy Archibald played a transition season at tiny Arizona Western College, where he rose as a high school star with an average of 29.5 points per game.</p><p>Right then, he began to work on his academics and transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In UTEP, he stood as the point guard, where he worked under Hall of fame coach <strong>Don Haskins</strong>.</p><p>From 1967 to 1970, Archibald maintained attention towards him, especially since his 51-point performance in the 1970 Aloha Classic.</p><h2>How tall Is Nate Archibald? Age, Height, And Body Measurements</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nate was born on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>September 2, 1948</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, making him 73. Also, his birth sign is Virgo.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And from what we know, people who fall under this sun sign are typically practical, determined, sensible, and brave.</span></p><p>Nate Archibald used to be lean as a player, nor was he highly built; however, he starred in every performance. Archibald stands at a decent height of 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) while weighing 150 lb (68 kg).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stat-Balls.jpg><p>As for his appearance, Archibald has a dark brown skin tone with black eyes and the same hair color.

However, he couldn’t play much for the team as he struggled with a foot injury, ending with 34 games.</p><h3><span id=Buffalo_Braves class=mw-headline>Buffalo Braves</span></h3><p>As his injury was prolonged, the Nets traded Archibald to the Buffalo Braves.

During the opening, he tore his Achilles tendon, which kept him away from the games.</p><h3><span id=Boston_Celtics class=mw-headline>Boston Celtics</span></h3><p>Later, the Buffaloes traded Archibald to the Celtics, where he had a poor start.

You look at players like<a href=# rel=noopener> Charles Barkley</a> and Patrick Ewing and realize how lucky you were to win it all. I was able to persevere through the injuries and keep learning the game. I was the facilitator on a championship team. To do it with the Boston Celtics is a dream come true and something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.”<br>-Nate Archibald</p><h2>Post-NBA</h2><p>During his NBA career, Nate Archibald took his bachelor’s degree parallelly from the University of Texas-El Paso.</p><p>After he closed his basketball career, Archibald commenced teaching in the New York City school system and then at Fordham University.</p><p>In 1990, Archibald earned his master’s degree from Fordham University, followed by his professional diploma in supervision and administration.</p><p>Additionally, Archibald dreamt of having a doctorate through California Coast University in the future at Fordham.</p><p>All in all, he dropped it off after he found his lack of funds and motivation to continue his work on it.</p><p>Moreover, Nate also became the assistant coach at the University of Georgia for a season while he spent two seasons with Texas El Paso.</p><p>Equally important, he coached for various institutions such as New Jersey Jammers of the USBL and&nbsp;New Jersey Jammers of the USB.</p><p>Likewise, he has also coached in the National Basketball Development League.
