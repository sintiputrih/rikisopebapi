But this time she isn’t fixing automobiles. Rather, she’s applying her unique talents to personalize clients’ homes with custom amenities in a brand new show called </span><i><span>Steal This House</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Let’s learn more about her as this HGTV Cristy Lee Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>HGTV Cristy Lee On New Show Steal This House</b></h3><p><span>HGTV’s </span><i><span>Steal This House</span></i><span> premiered on July 9, 2022, and it indeed was surprising to see the automobile expert, Cristy Lee, working on houses — fabricating metal works for fireplace surrounds and kitchen hoods, or repurposing wood to create a one-of-a-kind 3D map.</span></p><p><span>Another surprise that Cristy had in store for her fans was the filming location. </span><i><span>Steal This House</span></i><span> was filmed in Detroit across southeast Michigan, including Canton, Royal Oak, and Grand Blanc, all of which are close to Motor City. Previously, </span><i><span>All Girls Garage</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Garage Squad</span></i><span> — shows that put Cristy in the limelight — were filmed around the Chicago area</span></p><p><span>However, </span><i><span>Steal This House</span></i><span> wasn’t the first HGTV show to feature houses in Detroit. HGTV’s </span><i><span>Bargain Block</span></i><span> restored houses on Detroit’s west side as well. But that said, the show did include the community of Leland for a while — which they regretted for they had to work through the snow.</span></p><p><span>According to Cristy, Detroit is her “home” and she feels that her “roots have been so deep in this state for so many reasons”, both professionally and personally. “My adulthood, my professional career … it’s all happened here. I have Michigan to Detroit to thank for a lot of amazing things in my life,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Overall, she was happy and proud to have helped homeowners (at the top of their budget) see things “a little bit differently” through her background in real estate and home restoration.</span></p><p><span>All excited for the show’s premiere Cristy took it to her FB to share, “I’m so proud of this show and beyond grateful for an amazing production crew, phenomenal homeowners/clients (you killed it Tim & Melissa), hardworking contractors, and the people closest to me behind the scenes that supported me every step of the way.”</span></p><h3><b>HGTV Cristy Lee Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>HGTV Cristy Lee flaunted a net worth of around $2.5 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>This go-to guru for all things cars and motorcycles started her journey after making a bold move from Daytona Beach to Detroit after college to invest in real estate. She then broke into the industry as a Radio DJ and it wasn’t long before she followed her passion for motorsports and got featured on FOX, NBCSN, ESPN, SPEED, ABC, and CMT as a Motorsports expert.</span></p><p><span>But her career really took off after she joined </span><i><span>All Girls Garage</span></i><span> as its host in 2017. Also, her popularity skyrocketed when she joined </span><i><span>Garage Squad</span></i><span> in 2019. Unfortunately, a year later, there rumors flooded around that the showrunners were trying to cut costs by writing Cristy off the show, and Cristy really did leave the show that year.</span></p><p><span>However, Cristy also had an appendectomy back in March 2020. So, she might just have taken some time off the TV to recover.</span></p><p><span>Before the above-mentioned shows, Cristy has also graced the screen of</span><i><span> Celebrity IOU: Joyride </span></i><span>(2021), </span><i><span>Shift Talkers</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Best of Top Gear</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>TORC: The Off-Road Championship on NBC Sports</span></i><span> (2014), </span><i><span>Tunnel of Fire </span></i><span>(2013), and </span><i><span>Wild On… </span></i><span>(1997).</span></p><p><span>Prior to her career as a moto guru, Cristy worked as a reporter in O</span><i><span>lympia Entertainment, Greater Media Detroit – 101.1 WRIF, Gail & Rice</span></i><span>, and</span><i><span> Feld Entertainment</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, she’s been a talent manager for </span><i><span>Powerful Image Productions</span></i><span>, and a brand ambassador for companies like </span><i><span>Kawasaki Motors Corp, Dana Incorporated</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Stanley Black & Decker</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, she attended </span><i><span>Daytona State College</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Cristy’s official site offered her signed posters for $15.</span></p><h3><b>Is HGTV Cristy Lee Married?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, HGTV Cristy was married. Unfortunately, she and her husband Oliver Gooden parented ways in late 2015. Reportedly, it was Oliver who filed for divorce in August that year.</span></p><p><span>Talking about her ex-husband, Oliver is 7 years younger than her. The last we checked, he worked as a Chief investment officer at CG Advisor Network. Before that, this </span><i><span>Southern New Hampshire University</span></i><span> graduate was a regional director at Steben & Company, Inc. for 4 ½ years.</span></p><p><span>We’ve idea who’s Cristy dating now.</span></p><h3><b>What Is HGTV Cristy Lee Real Name?</b></h3><p><span>HGTV Cristy Lee’s real name is Cristy Lee MacCoy.</span></p><p><span>She took her ex-husband’s last name “Gooden” after marriage.</span></p><h3><b>HGTV Cristy Lee Family</b></h3><p><span>HGTV Cristy Lee credits her success to her family; especially her father, Barry MacCoy.</span></p><p><span>According to the star, Cristy spent her childhood running around the greenhouse filled with orchids, a pool, and a stone waterfall — all hand-built and designed by her father. Somedays, he would even take her on joy rides on his dirt bike, where she sat behind the gas tank as a toddler. So, you can connect the dots where she inherits her passion from.</span></p><p><span>Also, Barry ran a local import auto shop where he tinkered with cars.</span></p><p><span>As for Cristy’s mother, Jean MacCoy, she is a North Providence, Rhode Island native. She turned 72 in September 2022. Barry was just 68 then.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw them, Cristy’s parents were married. Infact, for over 36 years! Their dream car then was a Porsche 991.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Cristy’s grandfather Henry A. Pezza passed away on January 31, 2015, at the age of 89. He served valiantly during World War II and after retiring, he made his way to Florida with his wife, Catherine around 1980.</span></p><h3><b>HGTV Cristy Lee Height</b></h3><p><span>HGTV Cristy Lee stands tall at a height of under 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is HGTV Cristy Lee?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Cristy was born on October 21, 1977.
