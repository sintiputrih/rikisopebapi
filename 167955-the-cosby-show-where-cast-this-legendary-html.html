With more than 30 million viewers in its two most successful seasons, the program received more than one hundred awards and nominations.</p><p class=dh>There is no doubt that the series reversed the way African-Americans were presented on television because although there were other successful series, they maintained the stereotypes. "The Bill Cosby Show" showed what happens in a family with both parents present, educated and successful.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>BILL COSBY – HEATHCLIFF “CLIFF” HUXTABLE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Comedian Bill Cosby plays the adorable, funny, and hardworking father that all viewers wanted to have.

From 1994 to 1995, he starred in "The Cosby Mysteries", followed by the Cosby sitcom from 1996 to 2000. At the same time, he hosted the "Kids Say the Darnedest Things" series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/aa6a44243c14b5d40231520a095817a19437421566372297.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Cosby l Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In 2004, he released a live-action film "Fat Albert," won the Mark Twain Award for American Humor in 2009, and organized a gala at "Just for Laughs" in Montreal, the world's largest comedy festival.</p><p class=dh>In 2010, accusations about inappropriate sexual behavior from several women against Cosby began and he is currently serving a sentence of three to ten years for sexual assault on a woman 15 years ago. His lawyers recently requested the annulment of this sentence.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>PHYLICIA RASHAD - CLAIR HUXTABLE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Phylicia is the elegant, intelligent, hardworking and always in control wife, mom, and lawyer Clair Huxtable.
