Not only did the show last an impressive ten seasons but the show also marked the first time an entire cast stuck together to be paid $1 million an episode each.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Friends': Chandler's 10 Best Episodes&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>While&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;is without a doubt iconic, it would not have reached such iconic status without the six characters fans have come to love or hate. Ross Geller is definitely one of the characters who fall into the muddled gray area. Fans either love him or hate him and there's no changing their mind. Still,<a href=#> the paleontologist who is hopelessly in love with his sister's best friend</a> did have some shining moments throughout the ten seasons that made even the naysayers appreciate Ross.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-ross-finds-out-season-2-episode-7><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'The One Where Ross Finds Out' (Season 2, Episode 7)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-Where-Ross-Finds-Out.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of the buzz around&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;in the early years had to do with Ross and Rachel's will-they won't-they style relationship. The first season did an excellent job setting up that Ross still loved Rachel and this theme continued throughout the show.</p><p>During season 2, Ross and Rachel got their first chance to be together in the episode&nbsp;"The One Where Ross Finds Out." Ross finally got the kiss he'd been dreaming of after learning that Rachel had feelings for him when she called and left him a drunk message. The scene not only shows off Ross's softer side but it's also <a href=#>one of the best kisses of all time</a>.</p><h2 id=the-one-with-all-the-resolutions-season-5-episode-11><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'The One With All The Resolutions' (Season 5, Episode 11)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-With-All-The-Resolutions.jpg><p>There's no denying that things weren't ever easy for Ross but most of the obstacles in his life were his own fault. Perhaps, that's why fans gravitate away from him</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Ross manages to steal the show in <a href=#>one of the best episodes of season 5</a>. After having a pretty bad year, Ross decides that his New Year's resolution for 1999 is to be happy and try something new every single day. He begins this challenge by buying a pair of leather pants that he wears on his first date with Elizabeth which proves to be a mistake when he manages to get the pants down but not back up after a visit to the bathroom.</p><h2 id=the-one-with-the-cop-season-5-episode-16><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'The One With The Cop' (Season 5, Episode 16)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-With-The-Cop.jpg><p>With so many characters, not everyone could be the star in every episode. What's interesting about Ross's character is that he managed to steal the episode when he wasn't the focal point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the episode might be called "The One With The Cop," it's more accurately remember as the one where Ross buys a couch and is too cheap to have it delivered. What happens next is one of the most hilarious moments of the show as Ross continuously yells "pivot" at Rachel and Chandler who have graciously offered to help him move the couch.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-joey-loses-his-insurance-season-6-episode-4><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance' (Season 6, Episode 4)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-Where-Joey-Loses-His-Insurance.jpg><p>Ross might not always have been the most relatable friend of the bunch but&nbsp;one of his most relatable moments occurred during season 6.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Friends': The 10 Best Phoebe Episodes&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the episode, Ross lands a part-time job teaching at a university.

Things get even worse for Ross when Rachel storms in mid-lecture to yell at him for not filing for the annulment. Embarrassed and nervous once again, Ross's British accent returns.</p><h2 id=the-one-with-ross-s-teeth-season-6-episode-8><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'The One With Ross's Teeth' (Season 6, Episode 8)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-With-Rosss-Teeth.jpg><p>Ross really hit his comedy stride during season 6 which helped make him more popular amongst fans at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this episode, Ross is<a href=#> excited to be going out on a date with Hillary</a> and decides to get his teeth whitened before the date to impress her.

However, Ross realizes that a holiday without Santa might be traumatizing so he tries to rent a Santa Clause costume. With all the costumes rented, Ross is left renting an armadillo costume which he explains is Santa's friend.
