Despite taking more than one break, the punk pop band has a long discography. They released eight studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums, three video albums, two EPs, and twenty-four singles. In addition to this, they filmed twenty-two music videos. Among their most popular songs, are hits like All the Small Things, What's My Age Again?, I Miss You, and <a href=#>First Date</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to a successful career, the band is famous for their constant break-ups. Blink-182’s <a href=#>guitarist and vocalist, Tom DeLonge</a> has left the band twice. First in 2005, and then in 2015. And, much to fans’ surprise, DeLonge is back in the band, once again. And, as great as it sounds, fans can’t help to wonder what happened between Tom DeLonge and his band members back when he quit the Blink-182. Does this mean the band is back together for good? We can only hope so!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest Member Of Blink 182?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-a-short-time-blink-182-became-one-of-the-most-popular-pop-punk-bands-in-america>In A Short Time, Blink-182 Became One Of The Most Popular Pop Punk Bands In America</h2><p>Blink-182’s original lineup consisted of vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus, vocalist and guitarist, Tom DeLonge, and Scott Raynor in the drums. The band was formed in 1992 when DeLonge moved to the San Diego area and enrolled in the Rancho Bernardo High School. He met Raynor in a battle of bands and, soon after, met Hoppus.</p><p>The trio first operated under various names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge renamed the band Blink. They had to change their name because an Irish electronica artist was already using the name Blink, so they decided to add “182” to it.</p><p>Between 1993 and 1995, the band began landing gigs recording both cover and original music. They released a demo tape in 1993, tittle Flyswatter, and in 1994 they Buddha, another demo album, and Cheshire Cat, their debut album, which was released in 1995 before they embarked on their first national tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the tour, the band started work on a second album, and signed with MCA, a label that worked with artists such as Alice Cooper, Lynyrd Skynyrd and New Found Glory. Blink-182’s second album, Dude Ranch, was released in 1997, with iconic singles like Josie and Dammit.</p><p>In 1998, Scott Raynor left the band, and was replaced by <a href=#>Travis Barker</a>. With Barker as their new drummer, the band released their third album, Enema of the State, in 1999. Between 2000 and 2001, Blink-182 spent most of their time on tour and working on two new albums.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>11 Lesser-Known Facts About Blink-182's Drummer, Travis Barker</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everything seemed to be going well for the band, until DeLonge unexpectedly revealed he was leaving Blink-182.

DeLonge’s departure from the band left him and his bandmates in bad terms. They cut all communication until 2008, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barker survived a fatal plane crash</a>.</p><p>Both Hoppus and DeLonge reached out to their former bandmate and, eventually, the trio reunited in the hospital to plan Blink-182’s reunion.</p><p>They embarked on a Greatest Hits tour and released their sixth album, Neighborhoods, in 2011. Unfortunately for their fans, the Blink-182’s reunion wasn’t successful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their sixth album didn’t perform as well expected and Barker’s fear of flying got in the way of the band’s world tour. In 2015, DeLonge announce he was leaving the band, once again. Except this time the band continued without Matt Skiba as his replacement.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Are The Original Members Of Blink-182?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-really-happened-between-tom-delonge-and-blink-182>What Really Happened Between Tom DeLonge And Blink-182</h2><p>After DeLonge’s departure, the remaining members of Blink-182 issued a statement which explain that the guitarist decided to quit demand to pursue other projects. “No hard feelings, but the show must go on for our fans.”, they wrote.</p><p>In response, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeLonge wrote a a letter to their fans</a>. "I love Blink and am incredibly grateful for having it in my life. It has given me everything...At the end of the day, all of this makes me really sad. Sad for us. Sad for you- that you’re witnessing this immaturity.", he wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite this public disagreement, DeLonge and his former bandmates seemed to hold no grudges. Hoppus and DeLonge reconnected in 2019 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom went through a divorce</a>. And when <a href=#>Hoppus revealed he had cancer</a> in 2020, Barker and DeLonge showed their support. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoppus told People</a> that when they both paid him a visit, the reunion “felt very back to what it should be: three friends sitting in a room.”</p><p>Whatever went on in that reunion seemed to smooth things between DeLonge and his Blink-182 bandmates, because they not only rekindled their friendship, but also announced a reunion. Not only is Blink-182 back with new music, but they’ve announced a reunion tour with an interesting video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmrJ%2BieqWxy6iloJ1dlrulecGloKejXWaFc3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-tomlin-erica-campbell-to-host-the-53rd-annual-gma-dove-awards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Tomlin &amp;amp; Erica Campbell To Host The 53rd Annual GMA Dove Awards">&larr;
