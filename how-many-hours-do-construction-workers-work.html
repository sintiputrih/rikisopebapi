Employers who don’t have proper overtime rules in place can expect large fines.</p><h3><span id=Do_Construction_Workers_Have_the_Right_to_Refuse_Overtime>Do Construction Workers Have the Right to Refuse Overtime?</span></h3><p>Construction workers can refuse overtime requests. However, the refusal to work overtime may provide an opportunity for another employee to be offered overtime and this can lead to missed opportunities of additional earnings.</p><h3><span id=Can_Construction_Workers_Work_More_than_40_Hours_if_its_a_Critical_Situation>Can Construction Workers Work More than 40 Hours if it’s a Critical Situation?</span></h3><p>In rare cases, construction workers can work over 40 hours when it is necessary to complete a project that could jeopardize safety if not completed on time.

The hours they work can vary, depending on projects, location, and weather conditions. It is important for employers to offer fair compensation and to provide safe working conditions.
