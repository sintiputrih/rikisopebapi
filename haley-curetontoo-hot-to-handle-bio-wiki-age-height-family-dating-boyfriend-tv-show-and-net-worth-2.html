Her other body measurements include Bra (Breast) Size 32C, Waist Size 24, Hip Size 36, Shoe Size 8 (US), and Dress Size 2 (US). When you look at her alluring body physique, it is evident that Harley engages in exercising and staying physically fit.</p><p>It’s unclear what her workout routine consists of, but it’s clear that she’s definitely been working out. After all, being on a reality TV show that requires you to be in a bathing suit most of the time is a really good incentive to keep your beach body in check.</p><p>Thanks to her alluring body physique, the young lady has been able to market brands via her social media, most especially her Instagram page. Her Instagram account is full of bikini shots of her hanging out at the beach.
