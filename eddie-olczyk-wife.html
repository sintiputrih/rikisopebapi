Eddie Olczyk can be described as a true sportsman with unmatched self-confidence in this regard.</strong></p><p>Eddie, a former NHL player and head coach, faced one of the most difficult struggles of his life after being stricken with cancer following his playing career.</p><p><a href=#><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/311739632/1284x722/cut.jpg alt="Eddie Olczyk Wife: Meet Diana And Son Nick Olczyk - Illness And Health Update " width=1284 height=722 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The NBC pundit is now cancer-free thanks to his never-say-die attitude and the support of his wife and family.</p><p>Eddie has returned to his old life routine after his sickness, and he has done it with great bravery. As a result, he is considered one of the game’s top commentators, which has helped him develop a gigantic enterprise with an unrivaled net worth.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Battled Cancer Together With Wife and Family</h2><p dir=ltr>Eddie sent the entire hockey world into shock post his cancer announcement in August 2017.&nbsp;The former&nbsp;Chicago Blackhawks forward announced his diagnosis of colon cancer and released a statement updating his fans about his health situation.</p><p dir=ltr>“I have been working with outstanding health care professionals and expect to be back in the broadcast booth after I complete my treatment. My family and I appreciate privacy during this time as we focus our attention on my treatments.”</p><p dir=ltr>Loved by almost everyone in the hockey world, there was no lack of support for the former NHL star after his announcement. The prayer took its effect a few months later when Eddie announced that he was cancer free post his treatment on NBC in March 2018.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>“I’m proud to stand here before everybody and you [Pat Foley] — my partner and my friend — that all the cancer is gone.”</p><p dir=ltr>Olczyk looked fresh as ever after announcing his victory against cancer. However, it was far from the case during his eight-month treatment procedure.</p><p dir=ltr>The commentator revisited his treatment days while talking to Chicago Suntimes in March 2018, and mentioned how he could have never made it through but for his wife Diana, and his family.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/247newsaroundtheworld.com//uploads/eddie-olczyk-family(1).JPG alt width=800 height=600 data-ezsrc=./uploads/eddie-olczyk-family(1).JPG data-loaded=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Eddie Olczyk along with his wife and four children.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: nchchockey.com)</p><p dir=ltr>“When your wife’s sitting there crying, and you’re crying, man, it takes your breath away. You’re like, OK. I’m fighting for my kids. I’m fighting for my wife. I’m fighting for my family. I’m fighting for hockey. I’m fighting for people I don’t even know.”</p><p dir=ltr>With his latest scans showing no traces of cancer, Eddie stands today tall and proud and free from the body-wracking disease.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>However, he remains grateful to his wife Diana, and four children, sons Eddie Jr., Tommy, Nicholas and daughter Alexandra, for their continuous support during his life’s darkest days.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Life After Defeating Illness; Son Carrying Hockey Legacy Forward</h2><p dir=ltr>Eddie, age 52, post his victory with cancer, has resumed his life, just how he left behind. The former head coach has been serving as a television color commentator for NHL on NBC. His job at the NBC also sees the hockey great get properly compensated as he earns a salary of around $1million per year.</p><p dir=ltr>His huge salary figure has thus seen him enjoy a massive net worth amounting to $15 million. However, the hockey legend takes pride in one more thing apart from his professional accomplishments. His children, who have continued the family tradition of hockey.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Always remember: Family above all else <a href=#>#Thankful</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gs8jqGQgrS</a></p><p>— Nick Olczyk (@NOlczyk16) <a href=#>November 29, 2019</a></p><p dir=ltr>Eddie’s eldest son, also named Eddie, aged 26, serves as an assistant coach at Niagara University. His other two sons, Tommy, 25 and Nick, 19 are pursuing their playing career as well.</p><p dir=ltr>Hence, after going through one of the toughest battles of life, Eddie stands today as a healthy and loving husband to his wife Diana, and a proud father to his four children, who seems determined to carry their father’s hockey legacy forward.</p><h2 id=span-data-preserver-spaces-true-what-happened-to-eddie-olczyk-span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eddie Olczyk Health: What Illness Does He Have?
