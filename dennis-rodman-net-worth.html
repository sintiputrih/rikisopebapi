He was a colorful professional basketball player both on and off the court, whose NBA basketball career spanned 20 years with five NBA championships. In addition, he also played for the Long Beach Jam, Orange County Crush, and Tijuana Dragos of the American Basketball Association, the Fuerza Regia in Mexico, and the Brighton Bears of the British Basketball League.</p><p>Rodman attended South Oak Cliff High School, but didn’t play basketball. After growing 8 inches in height, he played college basketball at Cooke County College and Southeastern Oklahoma State University.</p><p>Dennis Rodman was selected in the second round of the 1986 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He fit in well with the team, and his rebounding skills were phenomenal, getting 1,530 rebounds in 1992. However, in 1992, Pistons’ coach Chuck Daly, who Rodman often thought of as a surrogate father, left the team. Rodman demanded a trade and went to the San Antonio Spurs. The following year, Dennis Rodman had problems with the Spurs front office and found himself suspended several times.</p><p>After two years, the Spurs traded Rodman to the Chicago Bulls for the 1995 season. With <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, <a href=#>Scottie Pippen</a>, and now Dennis Rodman at his peak, the Bulls won the 1996 NBA Championship. Teh Bulls released Rodman in 1999 and The Los Angeles Lakers picked him up. He only played 23 games with the Lakers before the team released him. The Dallas Mavericks signed Rodman for the 1999 NBA season, but Rodman displayed erratic behavior and Dallas released him at the end of the season.</p><p>Despite making more than $27 million in his lifetime, five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman’s net worth is only about $500,000.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=dennis-rodmans-nba-highlights>Dennis Rodman’s NBA Highlights</h2><ul><li>Rodman earned seven NBA rebounding champion crowns in his career (1992-1998).</li><li>Rodman got a career-high 34 rebounds in a March 1992 game.</li><li>He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.</li><li>His Pistons jersey was retired (No. 10).</li><li>He was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=dennis-rodman-net-worth>Dennis Rodman Net Worth</h2><p>During his NBA career, Dennis Rodman made approximately $27,000,000.00.

Dennis’s sisters, Debra Rodman and Kim Rodman, excelled at basketball, being named All-Americans in college.</p><p>Dennis Rodman has been married three times. His first wife was Annie Bakes. Rodman’s relationship with Annie began dating in 1987. The couple welcomed a daughter, Alexis Caitlyn, in 1988 and married in 1992.
