She grew up naturally sporty, with her athleticism earning her the nickname "Rubber band" at school.</p><p id=eiBN9QKdk3 data-wc=74>When she was 22, the future Playboy pin-up moved to Vancouver to broaden her horizons. And it was there, at a Canadian Football League game, that she was caught on the stadium's big screen by a cameraman during a break in play. The crowd erupted at the sight of Pamela wearing a tight t-shirt emblazoned with the logo of Labatt's beer. Following the popularity, the Canadian brewery was quick to make her its spokesmodel.</p><h2>Start of modelling and acting career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/25d2516f9018-pamela-anderson-baywatch.jpg><p id=esZ6kNfz5sv data-wc=52>The ambitious British Columbia native then moved to LA, where she posed for Playboy, later becoming the magazine's most popular playmate, gracing more front covers than any other. This led to a series of minor TV roles, and in 1991 Pamela landed a part on the Emmy-award winning US sitcom Home Improvement.</p><p id=eiNq9Pa4O7J data-wc=40>She left the show to star as CJ in Baywatch alongside David Hasselhoff in 1992. And, as the series grew, so did her profile. The syndicated show, with Pam in that famous red bathing suit, made her a household name.</p><h2>Continued career</h2><p id=eMg5_nNiyY data-wc=43>Her popularity continued to make her career skyrocket and Pamela went on to star in V.I.P.&nbsp;from 1998 to 2002, while also picking up roles in Scary Movie 3, Stacked, City Hunter and the big-screen adaptation of Baywatch, which was released in 2017.</p><p id=e8M5t1sKdTR data-wc=53>Pamela has also entered into the world of reality television on several occasions, with many appearance on Big Brother&nbsp;ranging from the Indian, to the British, to even the Bulgarian iterations of the show. She has also appeared twice on Dancing with the Stars&nbsp;and even competed on British show&nbsp;Dancing on Ice.</p><p id=eqk_iXh8RHb data-wc=51>She has since focused on animal welfare issues and has starred in a series of PETA (People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals) ads. She has also campaigned against the hunting of whales, become a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics's MAC AIDS fund and the American Liver Foundation, among many other charities.</p><h2>Relationships</h2><p id=eHxSPeqrkV data-wc=62>Despite her liaisons with stars such as Dean Cain, Sylvester Stallone and Scott Baio, it was Pamela's volatile marriage to rocker Tommy Lee that made the biggest headlines. In 1995, after a four-day romance, the couple were married on a Mexican beach in their swimsuits. In the same year, a private video of the couple was stolen and distributed on the internet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/781496dd17ac-pamela-anderson-tommy-lee.jpg><p id=eNI_1Ax938 data-wc=71>In 1996, the then 29-year-old hit a low point personally and professionally. Her major foray into film, the action comedy Barb Wire, did less well than expected amid reports of a suicide attempt and miscarriage. The birth of her first son Brandon in the same year proved a revitalising force, however, and with the arrival of second son Dylan in 1997 her wild lifestyle seemed to have come to an end.</p><p id=eXqxWGXbrQR data-wc=58>Sadly, the family unit Pamela had so hoped for unravelled in 1998. The couple had come close to parting just before their second anniversary, and in 1998 Pamela filed for divorce. They were briefly reunited in 1999, and although for while Pamela dated model Marcus Schenkenberg, in 2001 she was still proclaiming: "I've never really stopped loving Tommy."</p><p id=eA_dgEcy0O data-wc=63>The following year, however, it seemed she'd moved on as she embarked on an on-off relationship with Kid Rock. Then in July 2006, she announced she planned on taking a second chance on love. "I'm finally getting remarried," she declared, before tying the knot in three separate wedding ceremonies. Just four months later the couple, citing irreconcilable differences, announced they were to divorce.</p><p id=eis8KYLGr8 data-wc=69>Pamela went on to find romance again with long-term friend Rick Salomon, whom she wed on October 6, 2007. However, in December of the same year she filed for divorce, again citing irreconcilable differences. She sought to annul their brief union in February the next year, giving "fraud" as the reason. The pair later reconciled in 2013, even remarrying the following year, however in 2015 they finalised their divorce.</p><p id=ebiZOe-jlT data-wc=68>The actress would go on to date French footballer Adil Rami from 2017 to 2019, before a short-lived marriage to Hollywood producer Jon Peters in 2020, although she denied the pair had ever legally married. In 2020, it looked like she found love with bodyguard Dan Hayhurst with the pair even marrying on Christmas Eve, however in early 2022, Pamela confirmed the couple have gone their separate ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xbGhkvaK5xKWYZpmembKzv86nZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sandra-bullock-bio-age-husband-children-movies-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandra Bullock Bio, Age, Husband, Children, Movies, Net Worth">&larr;
