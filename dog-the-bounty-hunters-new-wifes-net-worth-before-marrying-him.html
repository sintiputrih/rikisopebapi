The couple was married for nearly 13 years. About three months after Beth's passing, fans saw Duane trying to hold back the tears, still visibly grieving, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dr. Oz Show</a>. Later, in September 2019, Duane was hospitalized after suffering from heart pains that doctors were worried looked similar to a heart attack.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out he was suffering from a pulmonary embolism in the heart due to stress and high blood pressure. Luckily, he has recovered since. Duane told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX31 & Channel 2</a> that he was also going through difficult psychological things. So that didn't help. "I think, basically, I had a broken heart," he said. "And, of course, it's going to heal." Luckily, Dog found hope in his new love, <a href=#>Francie Frane, a former rancher and hunter who lives in Colorado</a>. What was Duane Chapman's new wife's net worth before marrying him? Here are all the details.</p><h2 id=what-does-francie-frane-do-for-a-living>What Does Francie Frane Do For A Living?</h2><p>On April 24, 2020, Duane officially decided to share his newfound love affair with a kindred spirit. At the same time, his words were still tinged with grief for his first love, Beth. He shared a pic of Francie Frane with the caption, "I scream & Cry Beth where are you why did you leave me then I look up & see you Francie & the pain turns to a smile I LOVE YOU WOMAN!!" This post surprised many of his fans who thought he was still mourning Beth's passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are Dog The Bounty Hunterâ€™s Most Shocking Scandals</a></span></p><p>Francie, the attractive blonde woman who stole Duane's heart, is a 51-year-old Colorado rancher. Although her net worth before marrying Duane is not publicly known, she rose to fame after she started dating the superstar. Her primary source of income comes from her professional career. Nevertheless, as <a href=#>her husband's net worth is $6 million</a>, she has an estimated net worth of $1 million. As per sources, she is making well over $50K annual salary.</p><h2 id=duane-chapman-and-francie-frane-lost-spouses-to-cancer>Duane Chapman And Francie Frane Lost Spouses To Cancer</h2><p>In February 2020, Dog the Bounty Hunter contacted Francie's husband, Bob, to help with work at his Colorado home, but was shocked when Francie told him Bob had died several months before Beth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duane told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The US Sun</a> that he and Frane bonded over recently losing their respective spouses both to cancer. Apart from his Instagram announcements on May 4, 2020, Duane also tweeted cheerful photos of him and Francie enjoying each other's company, including shots of her engagement ring.</p><p>The US Sun reports that Dog popped the big question on one knee during a candlelit dinner at their home in Colorado. The couple had been in quarantine together during the COVID-19 pandemic. Duane told the outlet The Sun that they were hoping to make it official after the Coronavirus lockdown was over. They wanted a lavish event with all 12 of his children, Francie's two sons, and their respective grandchildren in attendance. Dog tied the knot with Francie Frane on September 2, 2021, in Colorado Springs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-dark-side-of-duane-chapman-39-s-newfound-happiness>The Dark Side Of Duane Chapman's Newfound Happiness</h2><p>Many fans feel they've got a right to be upset with Dog's decision to propose to Frane so shortly after Beth's passing, and he's been on the receiving end of hurtful negative comments and backlash. The unconfirmed rumors that did their rounds in the media in January 2020 added fuel to the outraged fans' fires.</p><p>Dog had proposed to ex-girlfriend Moon Angell, but the whole thing was completely blown out of proportion by the media. Luckily for Dog, his family and close friends approve of his new chance at love. In response to poisonous fan criticisms directed at her dad's new engagement, his daughter Lyssa backed him up with a public approval on her verified Instagram account, exclaiming, "How cute are these two?!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Dog The Bounty Hunterâ€™s Ex, Tawny Marie Chapman?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn't long before Duane's daughter Bonnie also got involved after some fans had bad things to say in the comments of Lyssa's original post. Bonnie told them in no uncertain terms that all the haters should leave her dad and let him live the rest of his life in peace. On the bright side, quite a few other fans commented that they're supportive of his decision telling him not to care about the naysayers.</p><p>Bonnie also commented on Instagram that her father deserves to be happy, reminding everyone that Beth's name is still tattooed on his chest. "He'll never forget her and the love she gave him," she stated. At the end of her message to the world, Bonnie welcomed Francie into the family, saying, "There's always going to be one and only one Mrs. Dog. Welcome to the pack, Francie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=duane-chapman-39-s-new-wife-makes-him-happier-than-ever>Duane Chapman's New Wife Makes Him Happier Than Ever</h2><p>Fan's favorite Bounty Hunter is trying to keep a positive outlook during the fan outrage, jokingly saying, "And you know there's always going to be haters, and I probably arrested half of them." Francie added that they don't believe it's too soon as fans are claiming. She says that in life, "there's always going to be people who judge what we do or don't do." She emphasized that both of them spent three tough years supporting their sick spouses.</p><p>Also, Francie believes that her and Duane's love story is God sent and posted one of her diary entries for April 27 on her Instagram account. She wrote, "You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. So you cling to God and do his word with all your mind because that's all you need to do. And one day, I looked up from the ashes, and there you stood. Wow, God." There's no doubt that they have a beautiful love story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Internet Reacts To Dog The Bounty Hunter Saying He Has A "Pass" To Say N-Word</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ9dqbWmecGorKesqWK1trrTnqmsZZ6axG7DyJ%2BcrGWemsFuw86rq6FlkpqzsL7EZqSaqqKutq%2BzjKGgpmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tiffany-haddish-confronts-stallionaires-pooch-who-claims-to-be-her-lover.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiffany Haddish Confronts Stallionaires Pooch Who Claims To Be Her Lover">&larr;
