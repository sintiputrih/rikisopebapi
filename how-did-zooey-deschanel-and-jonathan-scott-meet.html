Zooey Deschanel also has a big fanbase after starring as Jess Day on the sitcom New Girl, which has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many great episodes that fans love</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott are a fan favorite couple in the celebrity world, and people are super curious after how they first met. Let's examine that first meeting, along with their romance.</p><h2 id=carpool-karaoke>'Carpool Karaoke'</h2><p>Many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carpool Karaoke videos got tons of views</a>&nbsp;and it's always cool to see who James Corden has invited on next. As it turns out, Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott's romance started with this show.</p><p>By November 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deschanel and Scott were Instagram official</a>. According to&nbsp;House Beautiful, Scott posted a photo of him and the actress, and it was clear from the big grin on his face (and the fact that she was kissing his cheek) that they were super happy together. He wrote in the caption, "Simply a perfect date night."</p><p>So how did the two meet?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;House Beautiful, they were shooting a&nbsp;Carpool Karaoke&nbsp;episode with Emily Deschanel and Drew Scott in August 2019, and it seemed like that is where their connection was born. Deschanel was still married to&nbsp;Jacob Pechenik at that point, but she became pals with Jonathan Scott. A source explained to&nbsp;People&nbsp;that they "realized there was more to it."</p><p>Deschanel shared with&nbsp;Today.com&nbsp;that she wasn't sure it was even a real date when she and Scott first hung out. She said,&nbsp;"He said, 'Are you bringing people?' and I was like, 'No, just me.' And then I was like, 'Should I bring people? Should I call my sister?'" While she loved watching the Scott brothers on HGTV, he hadn't actually watched&nbsp;New Girl, but once they were dating, he watched it all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Bryan And Sarah Baeumler The Richest HGTV Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=romance-in-the-air-and-maybe-wedding-bells>Romance In The Air (And Maybe Wedding Bells)</h2><p>According to&nbsp;Elle, Scott, and Deschanel&nbsp;"bonded over their love of music, film, theatre—and Christmas carols," as a source explained to&nbsp;People.&nbsp;After Deschanel said that she was breaking up with her husband on September 6th, 2019, news started coming out that she was dating Jonathan Scott.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In December 2019, the couple went to the premiere of&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;and they attended with Drew Scott and Linda Phan, his wife.</p><p>Of course, since Scott and Deschanel have been together for over a year, people wonder if they will tie the knot. In an interview with&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight, Scott was asked this question, he said,&nbsp;“I’m pretty confident that I will ask my girlfriend to marry me before I tell a reporter.”</p><p>Scott also explained that his brother is often involved in these types of stories, too. He said, “It’s the rumor mill that turns around. We were actually laughing because almost every story that comes out is ‘Drew Gives Permission for Jonathan to Wed Zooey’ or ‘Drew Gives His Nod to the Relationship.’ And so we coined the phrase, we were laughing, we’re like, so is Drew my ‘Brother-Daddy?’ Does he have to approve everything that happens in my life?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Selling Sunset’ Star Heather Rae Young Is Still Focused On Getting Her Wedding Body Ready</a></span></p><h2 id=working-together>Working Together</h2><p>Since Jonathan Scott is an HGTV staple, people were definitely wondering if Zooey Deschanel would appear on any of his shows, and that's exactly what happened.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deschanel and Scott&nbsp;were both on Celebrity IOU</a>. According to&nbsp;The Huffington Post, the project was the house of Sarah May, someone Deschanel is pals with, so she went on the show&nbsp;with the Scott brothers.</p><p>Scott assisted Deschanel with a crowbar&nbsp;so she could take a kitchen counter off and&nbsp;he joked, "That’s the most romantic thing you and I have ever done. She said, "I just don’t think this is my thing."</p><p>Scott has said a lot of sweet things about Deschanel and as he told&nbsp;Pop Culture&nbsp;in an interview, he's definitely in this for the long haul. He said, "I've totally fallen in love with her, and I want to be with her forever. It's the magic of HGTV."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair have been working on some house projects while at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, which many couples can likely relate to. He said that he enjoys an "eclectic" look when he's working on home decor and Deschanel likes that, too, so it sounds like it's a perfect match.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Christina And Ant Anstead’s Divorce</a></span></p><p>It definitely sounds like true love for Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott.
