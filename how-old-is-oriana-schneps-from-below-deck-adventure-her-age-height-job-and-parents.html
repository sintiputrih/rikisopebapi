Below Deck is the name of the first one, and Below Deck Mediterranean, Below Deck Sailing Yacht, and Below Deck Down Under are its spin-offs.

However, Captain Kerry knew Captain Lee long before he joined the cast of Below Deck Adventure.</p><p>Below Deck, Captain Lee Rosbach Talks About the One Person He Regrets Firing</p><p>Captain Kerry told people at BravoCon 2022 that he met the Stud of the Sea for the first time about ten years ago at a golf tournament.</p><p>When Captain Kerry was asked to be on Below Deck Adventure, he called Captain Lee to ask if he had any regrets about being on the show.</p><p>“When the chance to do this came up, I called Lee and asked if he would do it again if he had to do it over?” In the video above, Kerry talks about it. “ He said, “That’s for sure.”</p><p>Captain Kerry also met Captain Jason, Captain Glenn Shephard, and Captain Sandy Yawn when they all showed up for the BravoCon weekend. He showed off a picture of himself and Jason taken before the event began.</p><p>In the caption, he wrote, “Night before BravoCon, having a few beers with Captain Jason from [Below Deck Down Under] and meeting some great Bravo fans.”</p><h2>He was on Below Deck Adventure for a while</h2><p>Captain Kerry gave a big hint about the first season of Below Deck Adventure before it started.</p><p>“A lot of trouble is going on.
