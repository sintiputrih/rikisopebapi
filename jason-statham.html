Jason Statham’s scores of films have generated billions of dollars at the global box office throughout a multi-decade career.</strong></p><p>As a result, Jason is now one of the world’s highest-paid action performers. He routinely earns $10 million or more for a single film in which he is the principal star. His net worth is $120 million when coupled with that of his long-term partner, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Despite being together since 2010, they are not legally married.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jason Statham?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jason Statham</a> was born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, England on July 26, 1967. He grew up in Great Yarmouth, an English seaside town. Eileen, his mother, was a dancer, and Barry, his father, sold street wares. Statham was a football player at the local grammar school. Jason Statham was a member of the United Kingdom’s National Diving Squad for twelve years before becoming a world-famous action actor.</p><p>Jason was a member of the British Olympic team that traveled to Seoul, Korea in 1988. Statham competed as a diver for England in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. After some poor results at the Olympic Trials and Championships, he decided to pursue a career in acting and modeling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Jason Statham make per year?</h2><p>The famous actor earns roughly $40 million per year. Statham is one of the world’s highest-paid action actors, according to these numbers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What investments does Jason Statham have?</h2><p>Apart from his performing career, the famed jewel has also dabbled in real estate. Jason spent $10.6 million buying an oceanfront property in Malibu, California, in 2009. He sold this mansion for $20 million in January 2020.</p><p>He paid $7.3 million for Ben Stiller’s Hollywood Hills property in 2011. He sold this house to Johnny Galecki of “The Big Bang Theory” in 2015 for $9.2 million. This house was previously owned by famed session drummer Hal Blaine.</p><p>Jason and Rosie spent $2.7 million on a property above the Sunset Strip in 2015. Their principal residence is a $13 million Beverly Hills estate down the street.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals does Jason Statham have?</h2><p>The renowned actor has several endorsement deals with brands like include Audi, Burton, French Connection, and Gazprom G-Energy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Philanthropy works has Jason Statham supported?</h2><p>Jason is quite generous when it comes to giving back to the community, particularly to the less fortunate. He founded the Jason Statham Foundation, which works in the United States and around the world to help children who are underserved in terms of education and learning.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many businesses does Jason Statham own?</h2><p>Jason was discovered by an agency in 1998, and his career in front of the camera took off almost immediately. In his early career, he also did some modeling for the clothing label French Connection and was subsequently seen by Guy Ritchie, who put him in the films “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” which grossed over $80 million at the box office and established Jason’s career in Hollywood. Statham worked with Guy Ritchie again in the 2000 picture Snatch, playing the part of Turkish. Statham co-starred with Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro in the film, which grossed more than $80 million at the box office.</p><p>Throughout the early 2000s, he acted in several films, including “The One” and “Ghosts of Mars,” but it was the action blockbuster “The Transporter” that made him a household celebrity. He was responsible for all of his own stunts (by choice) for this part, and he trained in karate, Wing Chun kung fu and kickboxing to prepare for it. Two sequels, a reboot, and a television series followed The Transporter. Ritchie cast Statham in a leading role in Revolver in 2005. However, it was a critical and commercial failure. Statham’s performances in The Bank Job and Death Race in 2008 earned him a lot of plaudits and catapulted him into the position of full-fledged action star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYrKeeYsC1rdOhmKZn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jake-t-austin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake T Austin - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, In Relation">&larr;
