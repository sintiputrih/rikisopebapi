Let us learn more about his Age, Ethnicity, Wikipedia, Real Name, Parents, Nationality, and Family.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Smiley is a widely renowned rapper from Toronto who has been making headlines since 2018.</p><p>He was linked to the well-known dispute between Pusha T and Drake. He has, nevertheless, made his mark in the music industry with two mixtapes: “Buy or Buy” and “A tape to Remember.”</p><p>Smiley released “A Road to Buy or Buy” in 2019. He released his album “YYZ- Lax” in 2020.</p><p>Moreover, he was producing songs in his home studio in 2020. He rushed the release of his record, not giving any thought to the music videos or marketing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-smiley-rapper-his-real-name-and-ethnicity-explored></span>Who is Smiley Rapper? His Real Name and Ethnicity Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Smily, a rapper, has recently had a lot to be thrilled about. His real name is Tavis Scoot whereas his ethnicity is Canadian.</p><p>Smiley, who hails from Toronto’s Pelham Park district, rose to prominence in his homeland owing to a distinctive vocal style that instantly distinguishes him on every song he touches.</p><p>Moreover, then he attracted Drake’s notice. Smiley and Drake released their debut collaboration, “Over the Top,” in July.</p><p>Shortly after signing with OVO Sound, the violent rap single gave him his first Billboard Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 57, and helped promote him to a broader audience.</p><p>Smiley tells Complex that the agreement came about in the same way as his rise to stardom did.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=smiley-wikipedia-bio-and-age></span>Smiley Wikipedia Bio And Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Smiley has been featured on the official Wikipedia page where we can find his introduction, bio, and his collaboration with Drake.</p><p>He is 23 years old as of now. However, his birthday is still unknown to us now.</p><p>“9 0 2” is the album’s most popular song, according to him. He’s ecstatic that everything came out just the way he intended it to.</p><p>Smiley has a distinct flair and a memorable tune that fans either love or despise. However, he is not unnoticed.</p><p>In addition to that, he has Drake’s approval; in fact, Drake used Smiley’s lyrics in an Instagram post.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=smiley-nationality-and-family></span>Smiley Nationality And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Smiley was born and brought up in Toronto, Canada. As a result, his nationality lies in Canada.</p><p>In spite of being well recognized as an artist, he has yet to talk about his family life.</p><p>He seems to be a private person who enjoys keeping his career path and personal life in two different separate ways.</p><p>On his Instagram feed, he just announced a new song called “Fresh Life.” He captioned a photo of himself relaxing by the pool, “Fresh Life” coming soon.</p><p>He claims he has a lot more videos to release in the rest of 2021. There is no mention of a new record, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yspKKkla56s63PqZyrZZWrsrPF06Ggp59dqbWiwIyypq5lo528trjDZqKnp6dirqO71K1koaGdZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-real-christmas-trees-harmful-to-dogs-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are real Christmas trees harmful to dogs?">&larr;
