Israel is known for being a fast and lethal striker, putting away his opponents on a whim.</p><p>In total, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel Adesanya</a> has quite a few tattoos and all of them are meaningful to the fighter. A wide variety of tattoos, ranging from anime characters to his pets, are inked onto his body. All of them have a backstory and a deep message that ‘The Last Stylebender’ wanted to convey.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel Adesanya Net Worth 2023, UFC Salary and Endorsements</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tattoos-of-israel-adesanya><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tattoos_of_Israel_Adesanya></span>Tattoos of Israel Adesanya<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Israel-Adesanya-has-an-impressive-net-worth.jpg><p><strong>The Chest tattoo</strong></p><p>Being a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native Nigerian</a>, Adesanya thought of getting a chest piece that says ‘The Broken Native’ with the continent of Africa integrated with a lion right below it. The fighter explains that the name of this tattoo was inspired by his old dance crew that he was a part of. Israel also goes on to say that he realized that the phrase should be his whole life story.</p><p><strong>The Avatar Toph Tattoo</strong></p><p>People who know Israel Adesanya well enough, know that he is a huge fan of the 2005 television series Avatar. So, no surprises were to be had when the fans came to know when the fighter tattooed a character of the show, Toph, on his right hand.</p><p><strong>The Werewolf on his shoulder</strong></p><p>One of the grounds where Israel’s fierce fighting style comes from is his love for werewolves.

Adesanya says that the bicep tattoo symbolizes the ‘power of imagination’.</p><p><strong>The Stomach Tattoo</strong></p><p>The Nigerian fighter explains the tattoo is a mixture of his favorite shows, Avatar the Last Airbender and Naruto. He said, “It’s the ocean and moon spirit from Avatar and the nine-tail seal from Naruto”. While talking about how the tattoo came about, he had this to say “I just mashed two of my favorite shows together and I thought it turned out well.”</p><p><strong>Pet dog on his neck</strong></p><p>Turns out the strong and tough fighter in the octagon had a soft side to him. Adesanya has a tattoo of his pet dog, ‘Millionaire’ on his neck. “I named him ‘millionaire’ for a reason because I knew what’s coming my way,” said the UFC fighter when asked about the tattoo.</p><p><strong>The huge back tattoo</strong></p><p>The middleweight fighter has a huge image of a dragon tattooed on his back. “It’s sort of Japanase-ey, the style of it,” said Adesanya as he described the tattoo. “I made it a crocodile dragon that just goes up my back,” said Adesanya. Though the tattoo was incomplete and was yet to finish, Israel said “I can’t wait till it’s finished, until I shade it all in.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arabic letter tattoo</a></strong></p><p>Izzy’s most recent tattoo was of an arabic lettering above his left eyebrow which read the word ‘dragon.’ The fighter posted a video of him getting the tattoo with the caption “The old version of you must die before you come alive! 🐲“</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-true-meaning-behind-israel-adesanya-s-naruto-and-avatar-tattoo><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_true_meaning_behind_Israel_Adesanyas_%E2%80%98Naruto_and_Avatar_tattoo></span>The true meaning behind Israel Adesanya’s ‘Naruto and Avatar’ tattoo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Q_1680081983-1024x768.jpg><p>UFC Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya is undoubtedly one of the best fighters on the roster.
