Though it definitely could benefit from more female characters, I was surprised how rapt I was by the soapy family saga. Two immigrant families in Mississippi — the Rudys and the Malcos — find themselves on opposite sides of the law with a rivalry that continues through generations. Listening is like binging a really good TNT series, one certainly enhanced by Beck’s deliberate narration. As much as I hate to admit it, lately Grisham has been pretty bulletproof on the audiobook front.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=b3EaFU data-merchant-id=203896 data-track-name="The Boys from Biloxi, by John Grisham" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=b3EaFU data-merchant-id=203896 data-track-name="The Boys from Biloxi, by John Grisham" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=gzvBUH data-merchant-id=203897 data-track-name="All My Rage, by Sabaa Tahir" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Listening Library" data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/df2/4dc/abb7baf742f8e36cdd78269ea9d3156c9c-all-my-rage.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=gzvBUH data-merchant-id=203897 data-track-name="All My Rage, by Sabaa Tahir" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Listening Library" data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>All My Rage, by Sabaa Tahir</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> $25<span> now 12% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> Photo: Listening Library<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbwsulw4001e3b6v0gd9l2xq@published data-word-count=16><strong>Read by: </strong>Deepti Gupta, Kamran R.

But it won the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature and was Audible’s top pick of 2022, so I figured I’d better give it a shot. Even with separate vocal narrators (all of them strong), trying to suss out the relationships between the characters in the first third of the book is a teensy bit confusing. But once their interconnectedness becomes clear, All My Rage turns into a powder keg that can explode at any moment. It’s a story that’s tough on all its characters, but it’s also one that’s pretty tough to turn off.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=gzvBUH data-merchant-id=203897 data-track-name="All My Rage, by Sabaa Tahir" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=gzvBUH data-merchant-id=203897 data-track-name="All My Rage, by Sabaa Tahir" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=Q7PKGn data-merchant-id=203899 data-track-name="Demon Copperhead, by Barbara Kingsolver" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d10/e64/a1894ce9de3652dc806e4237dabd34411f-demon-copperhead.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=Q7PKGn data-merchant-id=203899 data-track-name="Demon Copperhead, by Barbara Kingsolver" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Demon Copperhead, by Barbara Kingsolver</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> $35<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> Photo: HarperAudio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbwt2uud001t3b6vbfs7szjx@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> Charlie Thurston<br><strong>Length: </strong>21 hrs, 3 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>1.8x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbwt2wm5001z3b6vyu8zdkxj@published data-word-count=94>This contemporary rewrite of Dickens’s David Copperfield was ubiquitous this fall — Hello Oprah’s Book Club! Hello nearly every Best of 2022 list (<a href=#>though not Vulture’s</a>)! — so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a listen. It’s a longer audiobook than I typically prefer, and for me, at least, it drags in its final third. But for the most part, our orphan narrator, read with deep feeling by Thurston, is amazing company, even more so than the odd cast of characters he meets along the way.

He died in 2008. Scraps of the book were found by his family in his basement and they were stitched together to make this strange and affecting memoir. Obviously, here’s another example of where a fellow actor steps in to narrate, and in this case it’s the great Jeff Daniels. He’s an amazing interpreter of Newman’s intense self-analysis. (Additional readers who chime in to voice Joanne Woodward, Tom Cruise, and others are not as effective.) I don’t think I would have enjoyed spending time with Newman — it sounds like he was very hard to read — but this glimpse into the life of a reluctant movie star is pretty fascinating.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=q4452g data-merchant-id=203904 data-track-name="The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man, by Paul Newman" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=25 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=q4452g data-merchant-id=203904 data-track-name="The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man, by Paul Newman" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=25 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$25</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=GgCiKX data-merchant-id=203905 data-track-name="Dr. No, by Percival Everett" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Tantor Audio" data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bed/345/9ed60368bb8cd114bf7cc3419b691d29de-dr-no.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=GgCiKX data-merchant-id=203905 data-track-name="Dr. No, by Percival Everett" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Tantor Audio" data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Dr. No, by Percival Everett</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> $15<span> now 13% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> Photo: Tantor Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbwtrwzf00463b6vqjhicjgj@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> Amir Abdullah<br><strong>Length: </strong>6 hrs, 42 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbwtsbk800493b6v719zdonq@published data-word-count=97>Elliptical literary fiction is often better read than heard, but here it may be the opposite. This play on James Bond movies has an on-the-spectrum math professor named Wala Kitu — which, in Tagalog and Swahili, translates to “Nothing Nothing” — going to work for an aspiring Bond supervillain named John Sill. Don’t listen to Everett’s novel for the thrills, but more for the various jeux de mots. Abdullah orates all of them with an admirable flatness. Sometimes this feels like a seven-hour version of Abbott and Costello’s “Who’s on First?” but in a really good way.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=GgCiKX data-merchant-id=203905 data-track-name="Dr. No, by Percival Everett" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=GgCiKX data-merchant-id=203905 data-track-name="Dr. No, by Percival Everett" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/claslre35000m3b6wdo7b1hnr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>November Picks</span></h2><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=k3EaiD data-merchant-id=200971 data-track-name="Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, by Matthew Perry" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ef/4e9/2af61856f55357d2bf515bfd231f5d61ee-audiobooks-friends-love-terrible-thing.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=k3EaiD data-merchant-id=200971 data-track-name="Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, by Matthew Perry" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, by Matthew Perry</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> $20<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> Photo: Macmillan Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claslrx6t000w3b6wtq155e8l@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length: </strong>8 hrs, 49 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.8x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claslw1tw00113b6wmi5m5qlj@published data-word-count=144>I thought <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy’s memoir</a> about her relationship with her mother, the aptly named I’m Glad My Mom Died, was scary — but <a href=#>this book</a>, from the man we also know as Chandler Bing, is simply terrifying. It starts with the Friends actor (now a fledgling screenwriter) describing not being able to have a bowel movement for ten days. It quickly moves from there to his colon exploding. For anyone with a sensitive stomach, that’s like Buffalo-Bill-in-Silence-of-the-Lambs spine-chilling. This is already an intimate book, made even more so by Perry’s own audio narration. Things get more uncomfortable when he starts talking about his sexual addiction. But why else would you listen to a celebrity memoir? It’s a wild ride on 55 Vicodin a day, even if it just ends in a place where Perry describes seeking a life partner who’ll play pickleball with him.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=k3EaiD data-merchant-id=200971 data-track-name="Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, by Matthew Perry" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=k3EaiD data-merchant-id=200971 data-track-name="Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, by Matthew Perry" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=2uYFkL data-merchant-id=200973 data-track-name="The Twist of a Knife, by Anthony Horowitz" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8a1/93f/5e0edce90d38ca1edd75b639c138ce15f2-audiobooks-twist-of-knife.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=2uYFkL data-merchant-id=200973 data-track-name="The Twist of a Knife, by Anthony Horowitz" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Twist of a Knife, by Anthony Horowitz</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> $22<span> now 9% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> Photo: HarperAudio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claslzrm0000n3b6wi6v1i67u@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> <a href=#>Rory Kinnear</a><br><strong>Length: </strong>8 hrs, 31 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.6x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasm0d0c000s3b6wu6khg6ww@published data-word-count=87>I love this self-reflexive mystery series in which author Anthony Horowitz appears as a character who solves crimes with a gruff detective named Daniel Hawthorne.

I usually read these books, but I decided to give this one a listen.

To paraphrase Collins, small poems give you only a little bit of room for a flash of humor or poignancy. In a blink or a beep of a taxi horn you might miss a poem or two, which is why I found myself rewinding quite often. I can also see myself listening to this amazing audiobook on a regular basis. It helps that Collins has a calming, folksy presence. I wouldn’t mind spending a half-hour with him every day; there’s so much cleverness here. For instance: “Tom Thumb’s Thumb was so small, it failed to get the attention of passing cars and trucks.

This novel is a creation story of the now-infamous Instagram gossip site, a Bildungsroman, if you will, about the fictional Cricket Lopez, who suddenly finds herself exposing secrets about not-exactly-gluten-free bakeries in Hollywood and celebrities like B.J. Novak. Listening doesn’t take too many brain cells — that’s a compliment, by the way. Once Cricket breaks the news to her readers that an Armie Hammer type has been biting women, things get cooking.

This follow-up is about Frankie Budge, a teenager in 1996 who accidentally creates a piece of street art with her friend Zeke that winds up taking on a life of its own. I’d read the novel a few months ago, but I wanted to try out the audio version too. It doesn’t disappoint, thanks to the innocence of Goodwin’s narration, which hides its own secrets. An afterword about the genesis of the book is especially moving when Wilson reads it himself.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=ZhLYL0 data-merchant-id=200995 data-track-name="Now Is Not the Time to Panic, by Kevin Wilson" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=8 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$8</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=ZhLYL0 data-merchant-id=200995 data-track-name="Now Is Not the Time to Panic, by Kevin Wilson" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=8 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$8</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=hX7GfY data-merchant-id=200994 data-track-name="The Light We Carry, by Michelle Obama" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fc6/e9c/b72c9f14780252bb92fb4f942910d680b1-audiobooks-light-we-carry.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=hX7GfY data-merchant-id=200994 data-track-name="The Light We Carry, by Michelle Obama" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=31 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Light We Carry, by Michelle Obama</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$31</span> Photo: Random House Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasmxgn300333b6wiuin89eu@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length: </strong>9 hrs, 59 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clasmxjcy003b3b6w6wqq3fwq@published data-word-count=91>Whether you consider it a call to arms, a memoir, or a self-help tome, I can’t say there are any revolutionary takeaways from this follow-up to Obama’s Becoming.

Regardless, it’s just fun to be around Tarantino for a few hours, listening to him opine on movies from the 1970s, whether he’s the one speaking or not. He’s so darn opinionated, and he loves a digressive sidebar. However, I can’t believe he remembers at what movie theater he saw each of these movies and with whom.

I’m not sure we really need to know about Wu’s high-school jobs working at competing bread stores in Virginia. Other parts are jaw-dropping. When Wu goes off the rails, she kinda goes off in a great way. For instance, I was especially touched by the repetition of a mantra she learned in acting class: “Get the fuck out of your head.” Also, for a Hollywood actress, she talks a surprising amount about oral sex and boners. She owns it, though. Late in the book, Wu recognizes that male genitalia appears a lot in her writing. “I adore penii,” she says. “They’re obviously on my mind.” This is also a woman who devotes an entire chapter to the cars she’s owned and mentions that she named her Prius “Masha” after a character in Chekhov’s The Seagull.

Urban also happens to be the co-founder of the Whole30 program, but she only refers to that detail a few times in the book, which I thought was a particularly good example of creating a boundary between writer and listener. If I wanted a diet book, I would have listened to that. Usually, Urban gives a green-light, yellow-light, and red-light option of what to say to protect your boundaries, so I should probably order a hard copy as a reference resource. But she’s very direct and no-nonsense; it’s a good companion piece to Nedra Glover Tawwab’s Set Boundaries, Find Peace, which I<a href=#> suggested last year</a>.

Her career blossomed at the same time that my love of movies did. So this month, she reawakened my early memories of Tootsie (shockingly, her first film audition and her first film), Beetlejuice, Thelma and Louise, and — swoon — Earth Girls Are Easy. In one anecdote, Davis reveals that every morning while getting ready for A League of Their Own, she and her makeup team would sing along to the soundtrack of Jesus Christ Superstar, and Tom Hanks dropped in daily to cameo as Caiaphas. I think that’s when I understood that she and I were soul mates. Her impression of Penny Marshall is a hoot.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=v2iC3L data-merchant-id=197069 data-track-name="Dying of Politeness, by Geena Davis" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=v2iC3L data-merchant-id=197069 data-track-name="Dying of Politeness, by Geena Davis" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=jTPmpg data-merchant-id=197107 data-track-name="The Family Game, by Catherine Steadman" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96b/94a/1388755afc67afee1602af3afc9a65dfca-family-game.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=jTPmpg data-merchant-id=197107 data-track-name="The Family Game, by Catherine Steadman" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Family Game, by Catherine Steadman</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> $18<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> Photo: Random House Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9myao4t003j3b6wc65v1466@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 10 hrs, 51 mins.<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9myb3oh003o3b6wf7g8s18n@published data-word-count=124>Steadman’s previous book, The Disappearing Act, surprised me as a <a href=#>great listen last summer</a>, so I was eagerly awaiting this follow-up. Steadman is an actress too, and she does a very good job at narrating her twisty tales. For my part, this had maybe a teensy bit too much in common with the 2019 Samara Weaving thriller<a href=#> Ready or Not</a>, but there’s enough different family intrigue to separate the two. It’s all about being careful of not just who you marry, but the family you’re marrying into, too. There’s a rather large death count here, which I appreciated for a “woman in jeopardy” thriller. A bulk of the audiobook involves listening to a tape-recorded confession, and the crackly production of that is terrifically clever.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=jTPmpg data-merchant-id=197107 data-track-name="The Family Game, by Catherine Steadman" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=jTPmpg data-merchant-id=197107 data-track-name="The Family Game, by Catherine Steadman" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=kbug1u data-merchant-id=197115 data-track-name="Mad Honey, by&nbsp;Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e20/0e9/04e6d4254feddc201a5fd3d1922039fe32-mad-honey.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=kbug1u data-merchant-id=197115 data-track-name="Mad Honey, by&nbsp;Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Mad Honey, by&nbsp;Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> $23<span> now 9% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> Photo: Random House Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mz8bvo004f3b6wzhqdt7xp@published data-word-count=14><strong>Read by:</strong> Key Taw and Carrie Coon<br><strong>Length: </strong>15 hrs, 12 mins<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mzhikb004s3b6wrn9fhsyn@published data-word-count=135>A friend texted asking if I would judge her negatively for reading this new novel by Jodi Picoult. Of course I wouldn’t, I replied, though I did, a little bit. And then I downloaded the audiobook for myself. I happily discovered it was read, in part, by the incomparable Carrie Coon. Picoult typically writes kitchen-sink melodrama, and this, with co-author Finney Boylan, is genuinely compelling kitchen-sink melodrama. Olivia is a beekeeper in New Hampshire. Her teenage son Asher begins dating Lily, a new girl in school. Then Lily (read affectingly by Taw) turns up dead. My friend said she was genuinely surprised by a twist halfway through the novel, one that I didn’t see coming either. This is a totally great road-trip listen, though I definitely missed the significance of the bees and the honey.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=kbug1u data-merchant-id=197115 data-track-name="Mad Honey, by&nbsp;Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=kbug1u data-merchant-id=197115 data-track-name="Mad Honey, by&nbsp;Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=4mAQM9 data-merchant-id=197119 data-track-name="Madly, Deeply: the Diaries of Alan Rickman, By Alan Rickman " data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=19 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3a4/a00/10fe3da0dfb88590c566ef9c0f82bdc937-madly-deeply.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=4mAQM9 data-merchant-id=197119 data-track-name="Madly, Deeply: the Diaries of Alan Rickman, By Alan Rickman " data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=19 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Madly, Deeply: the Diaries of Alan Rickman, By Alan Rickman</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$19</span> $21<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$19</span> Photo: Macmillan Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mzculz004m3b6wruobh3rb@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> Steven Crossley<br><strong>Length:</strong> 19 hrs, 23 mins<br><strong>Speed I listened</strong>: 1.7x–2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mzic9l004w3b6w5zekvloc@published data-word-count=177>Rickman, known for his roles as <a href=#>Hans Gruber in Die Hard</a> and <a href=#>Snape in the Harry Potter</a> flicks, <a href=#>died in 2016</a>, at 69, of pancreatic cancer.

I found the actor’s vicissitudes here very interesting — whether he’s getting stiffed with the bill by his fancy friends at the Ivy, hanging out until 4 a.m. at the Box in New York, or mistaking Jane Campion for Meryl Streep. Excerpts that particularly struck me: “Sometimes I truly hate this business,” “A trip to the dry cleaners is good for the brain,” and “Why is the actuality of one’s work so far from its intention?” Rickman made me realize a diary entry can be rhythmic and flip instead of emotional and in-depth. I’ve finally started my own, and hopefully Carrie Coon can do the audiobook when I’m done with the first volume.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=4mAQM9 data-merchant-id=197119 data-track-name="Madly, Deeply: the Diaries of Alan Rickman, By Alan Rickman " data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$19</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=4mAQM9 data-merchant-id=197119 data-track-name="Madly, Deeply: the Diaries of Alan Rickman, By Alan Rickman " data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=19 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$19</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=84i4is data-merchant-id=197122 data-track-name="Balladz, by Sharon Olds" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=10 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/440/444/c734f1802f9dd440f1a735a9356caeffc4-balladz.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=84i4is data-merchant-id=197122 data-track-name="Balladz, by Sharon Olds" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=10 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Balladz, by Sharon Olds</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$10</span> $11<span> now 9% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$10</span> Photo: Random House Audio<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mzlsli00533b6wb2l74tys@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length: </strong>3 hrs, 33 mins<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.5x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9mzx3ei005b3b6w8yexhr06@published data-word-count=116>Olds, a professor at NYU, recently told the New York Times that the poems in this new collection should only be digested one at a time, otherwise <a href=#>“someone might get a serious stomachache.”</a> Still, I listened all the way through and, even with my sensitive stomach, I was okay.

Excel spreadsheets? An iPhone App? A locked shed in the backyard? In this superlong novel, Charlie, a teenager, befriends an old recluse and discovers a portal to another world in, yes, a locked shed in the guy’s backyard. The first 12 or so hours of Fairy Tale are creepy, grounded Stephen King. Afterward, it gets a bit Wizard of Oz via H.P. Lovecraft, somehow managing to be all over the place and familiar at the same time. Still, 12 hours of prime King is great audio fodder, and Numrich (currently appearing in Tom Stoppard’s <a href=#>Leopoldstadt</a> on Broadway) provides Charlie with a wide-eyed innocence.

That’s a pretty fabulous pairing of high culture and low. It turns out they’ve got something in common too: the search for companionship. Lessons stays mostly with Roland Baines, a failed poet abandoned by his wife to raise their child. It’s a fascinating monologue bestowed with lots of feeling by the crisp, clear and erudite McBurney, whose last Broadway appearance was an audio-only theatrical piece called <a href=#>The Encounter</a>. There’s nothing truly scary here, but Lessons somehow chilled me more than this month’s Stephen King.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=vOvdd0 data-merchant-id=194041 data-track-name="Lessons, by Ian McEwan" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=vOvdd0 data-merchant-id=194041 data-track-name="Lessons, by Ian McEwan" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=27 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$27</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=lKpGPn data-merchant-id=194043 data-track-name="Bad Dolls, by Rachel Harrison" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=12 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/54f/203/939c28d2a01737d753b7c96c4173183399-audiobooks-5.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=lKpGPn data-merchant-id=194043 data-track-name="Bad Dolls, by Rachel Harrison" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=12 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Bad Dolls, by Rachel Harrison</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$12</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$12</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl8aezkee002a3b6voxfednfa@published data-word-count=19><strong>Read by: </strong>Helen Laser, Suehyla El-Attar Young, Frankie Corzo, and Phoebe Strole<br><strong>Length: </strong>3 hours, 56 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl8af0866002f3b6vjl714q5e@published data-word-count=105>I wish there were more than four stories in this collection.

There’s a bloody bachelorette party. And, of course, a psycho doll shows up.

It’s a rom-com about the making of a Hallmark Channel–like Christmas movie. We’re in a holiday village in Vermont, and the starring leads are Nolan Shaw, a former member of an ’N Sync–like boy band, and Bee Hobbes, also known as Bianca Von Honey. Bianca/Bee (played amiably by <a href=#>Nash</a>) is a plus-size porn star with a particularly popular OnlyFans (here called ClosedDoors). This book is not for those prone to blushing: Bianca once did a sex scene on a jet ski. There’s not much merry, cute, or even little about this book. Still, I laughed a lot, mostly because it’s so jaw-droppingly audacious and absurd.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=2z0oU3 data-merchant-id=194044 data-track-name="A Merry Little Meet Cute, by Julia Murphy and Sierra Simone" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=2z0oU3 data-merchant-id=194044 data-track-name="A Merry Little Meet Cute, by Julia Murphy and Sierra Simone" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=21 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$21</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=yMNOFa data-merchant-id=194046 data-track-name="A Hard Kick in the Nuts, by Steve-O" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Hachette Books" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f9e/bce/2cc12aec5f74e839c5bd062065fe02a1b2-audiobooks-3.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=yMNOFa data-merchant-id=194046 data-track-name="A Hard Kick in the Nuts, by Steve-O" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Hachette Books" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>A Hard Kick in the Nuts, by Steve-O</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> $19<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl8aff14p003a3b6vsqhmbgm2@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 7 hours, 8 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2.2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl8aff30p003i3b6vm98dbc5r@published data-word-count=74>“What exactly did you think you were going to get when you got this book?” the Jackass star asks early on here.

Classic Ri.” That’s a tale on the precipice of what Steve-O might call “insufferable douche,” but I loved it. I want to be able to roll my eyes and say “Classic Ri” whenever Rihanna does something amusing in my presence. Enninful reads the rest of this book with deep sensitivity.

I’m also fascinated by the lives of child actors. <a href=#>This is a warts-and-all portrayal of McCurdy’s mother</a>, a woman somewhere between Dee Dee Blanchard (a.k.a. <a href=#>Patricia Arquette on The Act</a>) and <a href=#>Mama Rose</a> from Gypsy. She’ll stop at nothing to turn her daughter into the next Dakota Fanning, even if that involves emotional abuse, eating disorders, and trying to stall puberty. I listened straight through; it’s hard to take a break from McCurdy’s take-no-prisoners narration.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=73nW1L data-merchant-id=192028 data-track-name="I’m Glad My Mom Died, by Jennette McCurdy" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=12 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$12</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=73nW1L data-merchant-id=202897 data-track-name="I’m Glad My Mom Died, by Jennette McCurdy" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=26.03 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$26</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=5v9V4H data-merchant-id=192029 data-track-name="Carrie Soto Is Back, by Taylor Jenkins Reid" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/58f/200/d529b9f884a59fe09483c0965146a8f593-ab-6-.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=5v9V4H data-merchant-id=192029 data-track-name="Carrie Soto Is Back, by Taylor Jenkins Reid" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Carrie Soto Is Back, by Taylor Jenkins Reid</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> $20<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl76d278y001g3b6v35i3vkb6@published data-word-count=12><strong>Read by:</strong> A full cast<br><strong>Length: </strong>10 hours, 30 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listed:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl76d37bq001m3b6vtkeq12cf@published data-word-count=135>I read this book — the story of the fictional Carrie Soto trying to make a comeback, in her late 30s, and reclaim her title as the best tennis player in the world — as soon as I could.

This is a fascinating companion piece. It was first published in 1985, but Priscilla Presley only recently recorded an audiobook edition. There’s a ton of bananas behavior in here: Elvis courts Priscilla at 14 years old. Elvis asks Priscilla for a break in their relationship when she’s seven months pregnant. Elvis takes a lot — and I mean a lot — of pills. Kind of bizarrely, the Dallas actress also giggles regularly as she reads, e.g., when she recalls riding her motorcycle up until her eighth month of pregnancy or when she asks the maternity nurses to let her keep her fake eyelashes on during labor.

With that in mind, this book, only available on audio, is a crazy hoot. I think it’s about a babysitter stuck with twins on Halloween Eve in a haunted house. There’s lots of talk of spider eggs, and that alone creeped me out and made me itch all over. Eek. However, I’d argue that the author would have been a better choice than the <a href=#>actress/“bagel enthusiast”</a> who is the narrator here.

Zhu is a queer Chinese Australian writer who posts self-reflective, inspirational, and encouraging blocks of text on Instagram. Zhu’s book chronicles a particularly emotionally abusive relationship and the recovery thereafter. Things can get a bit offtrack when the book enters gender-politic territory, but anytime Zhu focuses on the personal aspects of their life, it’s gripping. The narration is especially charged. As a kind of reset between each chapter, Zhu takes several loud, deep breaths on the audio track. It’s such a simple gesture, but the effect is incredible.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=5lDP4O data-merchant-id=192034 data-track-name="Be Not Afraid of Love, by Mimi Zhu" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=5 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$5</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=5lDP4O data-merchant-id=192034 data-track-name="Be Not Afraid of Love, by Mimi Zhu" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=5 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$5</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=zOoR7X data-merchant-id=192035 data-track-name="Wrong Place Wrong Time, by Gillian McAllister" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5af/1f7/7d37432cdf4b4eb2802cfbdb42332eb39b-ab-2-.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=zOoR7X data-merchant-id=192035 data-track-name="Wrong Place Wrong Time, by Gillian McAllister" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Wrong Place Wrong Time, by Gillian McAllister</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> $25<span> now 12% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl76e89ai00423b6vnnqctg8k@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by: </strong><a href=#>Lesley Sharp</a><br><strong>Length: </strong>10 hours, 7 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl76e8w2x00453b6vx58ve452@published data-word-count=126>There are so many female-driven thrillers out there that, like everyone else, sometimes I just need Reese Witherspoon to tell me which one to pick up.

Kim’s delivery might be monotone in places, but I found it steady, deliberate, and clear, so I didn’t have to miss a moment.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=hc4MBZ data-merchant-id=189789 data-track-name="Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>From $15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - custom second buy button" data-track-id=hc4MBZ data-merchant-id=197719 data-track-name="Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, by Gabrielle Zevin" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Bookshop data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=28 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>From $28</span> at Bookshop Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=jBvinK data-merchant-id=189813 data-track-name="Acts of Violet, by Margarita Montimore" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cb4/3bc/13f6c12f98ae78ab32a0288b46f8780242-acts-of-violet.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=jBvinK data-merchant-id=189813 data-track-name="Acts of Violet, by Margarita Montimore" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Acts of Violet, by Margarita Montimore</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> $20<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> Photo: FX<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5r4k56700153b6v4o3pua66@published data-word-count=12><strong>Read by:</strong> A full cast<br><strong>Length:</strong> 11 hours, 9 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.85x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5r4kkip001a3b6voi2i1e66@published data-word-count=120>I couldn’t get through Montimore’s previous book, <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Oona Out of Order</a>, but I figured I’d give her another chance because I’m a sucker for a novel about a magician. I’m glad I did. This one has a female magician as its center. Her name is Violet Volk. She disappeared ten years ago, leaving behind a sister, Sasha, who’s stopped looking for her even though the rest of the world is still obsessed with how and why Violet vanished. A lot of the story is told via a podcast about what happened to Violet, and, using a wide cast of actors, the audiobook version simulates that genre especially well. It elevates the experience far beyond the book’s less interesting kitchen-sink drama.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=jBvinK data-merchant-id=189813 data-track-name="Acts of Violet, by Margarita Montimore" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=jBvinK data-merchant-id=189813 data-track-name="Acts of Violet, by Margarita Montimore" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=r2D2fn data-merchant-id=189815 data-track-name="Reputation, by Sarah Vaughan" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/477/00f/9003752a5328dac8655b46815a4cf5d0c2-reputation.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=r2D2fn data-merchant-id=189815 data-track-name="Reputation, by Sarah Vaughan" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Reputation, by Sarah Vaughan</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> $18<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5r4r144001v3b6v8ek4zn6l@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> <a href=#>Julie Teal</a><br><strong>Length:</strong> 12 hours, 22 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>1.9x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5r4ropu00203b6vwdi01gt5@published data-word-count=115>Vaughan wrote <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Anatomy of a Scandal</a>, which became <a href=#>a big hit on Netflix</a> this year with Sienna Miller. I didn’t read or watch it, but I might go back because I enjoyed this follow-up so much. Emma is a politician who has an affair with a journalist. Her daughter, Flora, does something stupid, and the journalist finds out and wants to write a story. Somehow the journalist ends up dead inside Emma’s home. The mechanics are all more twisty than shocking, but the books makes up for it with the brittle humor, the none-too-subtle feminist slant, and the quick jump from crime to courthouse.

Probably not. Did I get a kick out of this trip down memory lane with the movie’s writer-director? I did. It’s rare you get a glimpse into the making of a Hollywood movie in minute detail, and this one’s pretty soup to nuts, down to Shelton hiring the on-set script supervisor. These kind of books always start and end with the idea that everyone in Hollywood is crazy, and it’s good to be reminded of that. To that end, here, Kevin Costner’s agents tried to prevent him from starring as Minor League Baseball star Crash Davis, which&nbsp;turned out to be one of his most iconic roles. Shelton has a knowing but aw-shucks vibe that makes great company even if his performance of dialogue scenes from the original script could use more oomph.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=o43Ji5 data-merchant-id=189816 data-track-name="The Church of Baseball, by Ron Shelton" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=o43Ji5 data-merchant-id=189816 data-track-name="The Church of Baseball, by Ron Shelton" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=BiplPl data-merchant-id=189817 data-track-name="Hollywood Ending, by Ken Auletta" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4a6/24e/f40fd203cbdeae45f3e58d5508e625f2c1-hollywood-ending.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=BiplPl data-merchant-id=189817 data-track-name="Hollywood Ending, by Ken Auletta" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Hollywood Ending, by Ken Auletta</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> $23<span> now 13% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5r9vj8000313b6v95h5ee17@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by: </strong>Jonathan Coleman<br><strong>Length:</strong> 19 hors, 41 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5ra2hjv003a3b6vjwukt4hf@published data-word-count=110>A darker addition to July’s “Hollywood Is Crazy Files” is this gripping account of Harvey Weinstein’s rise to a<a href=#>nd fall from power</a>.

Auletta’s reporting is mostly firsthand, and hearing it cumulatively is jaw-dropping.

Finding the wooden duck sets things in motion, leading to a duck-decoy scam and a duck-decoy romance, fulfilling all your duck-decoy desires.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=6V94Re data-merchant-id=187857 data-track-name="Flying Solo, by Linda Holmes" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=6V94Re data-merchant-id=187857 data-track-name="Flying Solo, by Linda Holmes" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=5l4Pf1 data-merchant-id=187858 data-track-name="The House Across the Lake, by Riley Sager" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a31/246/42a8f865590de3b44f1d73e43ac4056dbd-the-house-across-the-lake.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=5l4Pf1 data-merchant-id=187858 data-track-name="The House Across the Lake, by Riley Sager" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Penguin Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The House Across the Lake, by Riley Sager</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> $20<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r1aziv001v3b6u7k008drp@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by: </strong><a href=#>Bernadette Dunne</a><br><strong>Length: </strong>11 hours, 3 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r1dj5a001y3b6u6pwcg3pq@published data-word-count=116>While life turns out okay for Holmes’s heroines, things aren’t quite as peachy for the protagonist in this thriller.

Casey has a drinking problem, of course, and there’s a sprinkle of <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Woman in the Window</a>, a dash of <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Girl on the Train</a>, and a little bit of <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>What Lies Beneath</a>. Regardless of the tropes, it’s all about Bernadette Dunne’s performance.

That’s what happened listening to this book about a Cardi B–like rapper named Danielle “Duchess” Nelson who has an affair with the gorgeous, tall Prince Jameson. The flap copy suggests the plot is inspired by Meghan “Duchess” Markle and Prince Harry. I suppose it’s not that much of a stretch. I <a href=#>hung out with Markle</a> a bit when she was married to her first husband. We nicknamed her “So Delicious” because she endearingly knew all the lyrics of “<a href=#>Fergalicious</a>.” Like many books of this ilk, the narrators alternate reading chapters. Antony Ferguson’s are a bit flat. He voices Duchess as if she’s a southern Belle from Steel Magnolias. Wesleigh Siobhan, however, is delightful. But beware: Things begin amusingly enough, but very quickly Prince Jameson’s, well, little prince, starts stirring and/or throbbing on the regular.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=m7nnXt data-merchant-id=187859 data-track-name="American Royalty, by Tracey Livesay" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=6 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$6</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=m7nnXt data-merchant-id=187859 data-track-name="American Royalty, by Tracey Livesay" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=6 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$6</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=KtIy7V data-merchant-id=187863 data-track-name="Cult Classic, by Sloane Crosley" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8f2/6a7/61abe12a9dfbfef6fa885f726335208077-cult-classic.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=KtIy7V data-merchant-id=187863 data-track-name="Cult Classic, by Sloane Crosley" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Cult Classic, by Sloane Crosley</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> $15<span> now 13% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$13</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r2peoq002w3b6ub9wpmcu3@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 8 hours, 9 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>1.7x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r2qdzk00313b6u926temxi@published data-word-count=105>There are some books that are perfect to consume as you amble around New York City.

(In real life, he’s also gotten into some <a href=#>hot water</a> lately.) But I guess selling trillions of books makes you look like Kevin Costner. I expected Patterson to have a booming movie-trailer voice, but instead it’s just regular and squawky. The early chapters in this collection of quick bites can be annoying. The way he describes working at a mental institution — both <a href=#>James Taylor</a> and Susanna Kaysen (Girl Interrupted) were patients — can feel flip. But before I knew it, Patterson was ingratiating himself in my life. He hooked me when he called Jeffrey Epstein&nbsp;a “piece of human garbage.” (Patterson <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>co-authored a 2016 book</a> about his Palm Beach “neighbor” Epstein, which became a Netflix documentary.) He also dreams about getting nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize only to arrive in Stockholm and discover it is a great big joke. He wishes that Hollywood would make a decent movie or TV show out of one of his properties. And while he knows it’s great that he’s the best-selling writer in the world, a lifetime of reading great literature suggests it’s also “sad” that that’s the case. A specific quibble: I wish Patterson’s reading recommendations throughout were as diverse as the many series on his bibliography.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=My6C59 data-merchant-id=187866 data-track-name="James Patterson, by James Patterson" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=My6C59 data-merchant-id=187866 data-track-name="James Patterson, by James Patterson" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=13 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$13</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=tuizsk data-merchant-id=187870 data-track-name="Be My Baby, by Ronnie Spector" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/945/980/7207dd6eb814e02f3b90d23dd0d15e8226-be-my-baby.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=tuizsk data-merchant-id=187870 data-track-name="Be My Baby, by Ronnie Spector" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Macmillan Audio" data-track-price=18 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Be My Baby, by Ronnie Spector</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span> $20<span> now 10% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$18</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r3fi41004c3b6ukr5bfjl1@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by: </strong>Rosie Perez<br><strong>Length: </strong>10 hours, 43 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.85</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4r3fp6a004f3b6upulnf1xf@published data-word-count=131>Ronnie Spector, the lead singer of the Ronettes and ex-wife of notorious music producer Phil Spector, had recently <a href=#>finished revising her 1990 memoir</a> when she <a href=#>died in January</a>.

But Perez’s emotion toward Ronnie feels so genuine, whether when she breaks out giggling at a particularly amusing moment in Ronnie’s life or starts sniffling during a more tragic turn.

He wrote “<a href=#>House at Pooh Corner</a>” when he was 17, perhaps foreshadowing his marriage to his colonic hygienist in 1992.

Sometimes books don’t always hit you at the right moment, but this is one of those that stays with you for a long time.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=bWnTDS data-merchant-id=187874 data-track-name="Nightcrawling, by Leila Mottley" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=bWnTDS data-merchant-id=187874 data-track-name="Nightcrawling, by Leila Mottley" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4r3vwn6004z3b6uvgnn13xl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>May Picks</span></h2><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=65u4ow data-merchant-id=185587 data-track-name="Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History, by Glen Berger" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/59c/7e4/2799e5bfdce43eb6522cb8b039bff88886-song-of-spiderman.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=65u4ow data-merchant-id=185587 data-track-name="Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History, by Glen Berger" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History, by Glen Berger</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> $18<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3aaxzoy000q3h6jeat594x9@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 10 hours, 55 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened: </strong>1.9x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3aay0xg000y3h6jq4mzcc6r@published data-word-count=108>This is a crazy honest book. Since it was published in 2013, I’ve read Song of Spider-Man twice. Now it’s being released for the first time on audio. Berger gives his raw, personal account of his time writing the script with Julie Taymor of the epically troubled musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. The play, which closed in January 2014, may be Broadway ancient history, but this memoir still cuts to the bone, partly because Berger is so candid about the artistic process behind the runaway-train production. There’s so much insecurity, so much backstabbing, so much back-channeling, I’m almost surprised that Hulu hasn’t adapted it into a docudrama.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=65u4ow data-merchant-id=185587 data-track-name="Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History, by Glen Berger" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=65u4ow data-merchant-id=185587 data-track-name="Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History, by Glen Berger" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=bFqlmk data-merchant-id=185591 data-track-name="Happy-Go-Lucky, by David Sedaris" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Little, Brown & Company" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/eac/52b/b74893192afe7d32396054ba206eb5a67c-happy-go-lucky.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=bFqlmk data-merchant-id=185591 data-track-name="Happy-Go-Lucky, by David Sedaris" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Little, Brown & Company" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Happy-Go-Lucky, by David Sedaris</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> $19<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c3tl9g002o3f6ntgmj766m@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 7 hours, 30 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened</strong>: 1.3x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c3z639002z3f6ns2mwsqo7@published data-word-count=161>I crow a lot about David Sedaris audiobooks, but that’s because the category was pretty much built for him. These essays, some performed in front of an audience, made me laugh — and laugh loudly while waiting for the Q train on 57th Street. People stared. In this collection, Sedaris talks a bit more circumspectly about his father, who died in 2021, than he has in the past, and his observations about his marriage with Hugh are funnier than ever. Sedaris spent a lot of time on the Upper East Side during the pandemic. He bought one apartment, he writes, and then another one upstairs to have some alone time. (His sister Amy did the same thing downtown, but so she could get a break from her pet rabbit.) Now that I know he might be in the neighborhood, I’m keeping an eye out for him with the hope that one day we can go shopping together at Comme des Garçons.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=bFqlmk data-merchant-id=185591 data-track-name="Happy-Go-Lucky, by David Sedaris" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=bFqlmk data-merchant-id=185591 data-track-name="Happy-Go-Lucky, by David Sedaris" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=MJkiDc data-merchant-id=185590 data-track-name="Meant to Be, by Emily Giffin" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a2e/ef5/a36912ace08827108ae9c345a8494d8065-meant-to-be.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=MJkiDc data-merchant-id=185590 data-track-name="Meant to Be, by Emily Giffin" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Meant to Be, by Emily Giffin</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> $18<span> now 11% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c3oc5600233f6n1gcqiui5@published data-word-count=14><strong>Read by</strong>: Caroline Hewitt and Robert Petkoff<br><strong>Length: </strong>11 hours, 31 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 1.9x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c3r63e002b3f6n3w3f0hlg@published data-word-count=138>Years ago, when I plowed through Jennifer Weiner’s oeuvre on audio, that led to me to start on the Emily Giffin catalogue. They both write what might be considered elevated women’s fiction. This month, I decided to skip Weiner’s latest, <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Summer Place</a> (even if it is read by <a href=#>Sutton Foster</a>) and go for Giffin’s instead. Meant to Be is a loose retelling of a relationship like JFK Jr.’s and Carolyn Bessette. Joe Kingsley III, a political scion and lawyer, meets Cate Cooper, a fledgling supermodel, on the beach in Southampton. Are they meant for each other? Check out the title and give it a guess. Hewitt and Petkoff narrate alternating chapters more than pleasantly. They make the book go down like a pitcher of frosé.

In this book of essays, Driver admits her manager asked what she wanted to do to make some money during the Hollywood shutdown. She chose to write a memoir. On audio, she’s very likable company, especially when she talks about the tumult of dating Matt Damon (whom she met on Good Will Hunting) and exquisitely pronounces phrases in a variety of foreign tongues. Driver makes you believe she actually knows what the word “Proustian” means. Stay for the end when the author Emma Forrest — you should read or listen to <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Your Voice in My Head</a> — interviews Driver.

He started with being an extra on Pacific Rim and actually enjoyed it. That led to more jobs as extras, some pop-up flash mobs, and, eventually, the Canadian sitcom Kim’s Convenience. Liu is surprisingly tough on his Chinese immigrant parents who gave him a hard time about some of his choices, though he also, quite touchingly, interviewed them extensively for this memoir. Like the MCU hero he plays onscreen, Liu is totally endearing, whether he’s recalling the high-school boy band he started or how much he loves boba tea.

Baby, a.k.a. Jennifer Grey, won’t be put in the corner ever again, but I especially responded to a moment where Grey uses the term “legend lasagna.” She’s describing the cast of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Cotton Club, which is filled with just “layer upon layer of geniuses.” Why didn’t Grey take a big swing and call this book Legend Lasagna? That’s just a marvelous expression that transcends pasta and celebrity. I was never a huge fan of Dirty Dancing or the Catskills, but there’s something dazzling about Grey’s candor, not to mention her congenial narration. We get great digressions about Matthew Broderick, Johnny Depp, and a terrible appearance on Johnny Carson. Things only get sappy in the end, once she wins Dancing With the Stars. And, yes, I know no publisher would approve Legend Lasagna by Jennifer Grey, though maybe if this one does well, she’ll write a cookbook.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=LZSbSO data-merchant-id=185596 data-track-name="Out of the Corner, by Jennifer Grey" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=LZSbSO data-merchant-id=185596 data-track-name="Out of the Corner, by Jennifer Grey" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=16 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$16</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=kTqvlF data-merchant-id=185597 data-track-name="Back to the Prairie, by Melissa Gilbert" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/566/bfb/a0ae2ea3a61a05896fc7016916a6fffae8-back-to-the-praire.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=kTqvlF data-merchant-id=185597 data-track-name="Back to the Prairie, by Melissa Gilbert" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster Audio" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Back to the Prairie, by Melissa Gilbert</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c4p5hw006t3f6nt0h91rcx@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by</strong>: The author<br><strong>Length:</strong> 7 hours, 2 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2.1x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c4pr2u006y3f6n94aizog0@published data-word-count=145>Gilbert was the lead child star of Little House on the Prairie and also appeared, more recently, as an adult star of a <a href=#>Little House on the Prairie musical</a>.

Though Gilbert relies on way too many puns about raising chickens, I want to throw my support around anyone who has a chapter in her book called “Meshuggah from Michigan” and willingly describes <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>stuffing-flavored potato chips</a> she found at Trader Joe’s as “life-changing.” They don’t serve stuffing-flavored potato chips at the Met Ball, do they?</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=kTqvlF data-merchant-id=185597 data-track-name="Back to the Prairie, by Melissa Gilbert" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=kTqvlF data-merchant-id=185597 data-track-name="Back to the Prairie, by Melissa Gilbert" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=HHuUFB data-merchant-id=185598 data-track-name="Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up, by Selma Blair" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1fa/eee/01399d8a543fe1fd9906a655eee7229024-mean-baby.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=HHuUFB data-merchant-id=185598 data-track-name="Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up, by Selma Blair" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Random House Audio" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up, by Selma Blair</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> $17<span> now 12% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c4vyks007m3f6nu6bwemgk@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by: </strong>The author<br><strong>Length: </strong>9 hours, 43 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2.5x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c4wkau007r3f6nsxn399rj@published data-word-count=152>Of all the celebrity memoirs I listened to this month, this one’s the toughest and most intense. <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Miss Memory Lane</a> by <a href=#>Colton Haynes</a> is a close second and somehow even more unsettling. That’s a feat for Haynes because Blair, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, categorically goes there on some tough issues: her strained relationship with her mother; her even more complicated relationship with her basically estranged father; at least one sexual assault; her troubles with alcohol since childhood; and how her son, Arthur, was, like her, a “mean baby.” There are moments of inspiration and hope, but Blair seems to audibly break down at least once per chapter. I’ve listened to a lot of celebrity memoirs, and I can’t remember a narrator crying so much. But that’s what makes it real. Make sure you stick around for the acknowledgments. Blair’s thank-yous to a lengthy list of celebrity friends is a real trip.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=HHuUFB data-merchant-id=185598 data-track-name="Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up, by Selma Blair" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=HHuUFB data-merchant-id=185598 data-track-name="Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up, by Selma Blair" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=AgJ1h2 data-merchant-id=185599 data-track-name="The Office BFFs, by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d5/06b/39507a48f8524d041059fe9b3220bdd2a0-the-office-bffs.rsquare.w600.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=AgJ1h2 data-merchant-id=185599 data-track-name="The Office BFFs, by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=HarperAudio data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Office BFFs, by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> $22<span> now 9% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c52dvl008j3f6nagocrrji@published data-word-count=11><strong>Read by:</strong> The authors<br><strong>Length:</strong> 8 hours, 26 minutes<br><strong>Speed I listened:</strong> 2.2x</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3c53n21008o3f6nguv6u78s@published data-word-count=147>I liked the U.S. version of The Office — I really did. Do I like it enough to listen to <a href=#>Office Ladies,</a> a podcast on which co-stars Fischer and Kinsey talk through old episodes of The Office? No. In fact, I didn’t even know said podcast existed. Am I going to start listening to it now? Nope. But it’s a delight to spend a few hours with these actors as they discuss their early careers and the ups and downs of their friendship. Their banter is occasionally interrupted by, say, Ed Helms playing the banjo or <a href=#>Creed Bratton</a> singing a bizarre theme song. There’s a service element, too. Fischer and Kinsey give impeccable advice on attending awards shows and red-carpet events: Always eat before you go. Go to the bathroom with a buddy. And, when trying to meet people like Meryl Streep, use “the lap-around-the-room laughing approach.”</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=AgJ1h2 data-merchant-id=185599 data-track-name="The Office BFFs, by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=AgJ1h2 data-merchant-id=185599 data-track-name="The Office BFFs, by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=20 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$20</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cld0pn5w4000x0ihe755jhs3f@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>6 Great Audiobooks to Listen to This Month</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl1qmhhlf00000gn50mo21fe3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Best Books of 2022</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl6uyi3fw0000fhn6z8pmiyam@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Best Horror Novels of 2022</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Great Audiobooks to Listen to in 2022</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZJqtlJ68o7vOpKpmamBnf2%2B006aj</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./naomi-judd.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Naomi Judd">&larr;
