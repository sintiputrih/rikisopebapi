He advised them to pursue their passions rather than just performing. Robert stated,</p><p>“For my kids, I tell them, ‘If you want to be an actor or do this or that, that’s fine as long as you’re happy.”</p><p>He went on,</p><p>“Just don’t undersell yourself.” That’s all I’d recommend – push yourself a little harder and aim for what you truly believe you want to do. Don’t be scared.”</p><h2><span id=Julian_Henry_De_Niro8217s_net_worth>Julian Henry De Niro’s net worth</span></h2><p>His net worth is still being calculated.
