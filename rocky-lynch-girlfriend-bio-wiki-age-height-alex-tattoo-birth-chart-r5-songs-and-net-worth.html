His older brother Riker has confirmed in an interview that they are currently working on their third studio album In 2009, they created a YouTube channel and started a web series, ‘R5 TV’. The series focused on their day-to-day lives and documented the early days of the band.</p><p>The same year, Rocky also appeared on the TV show ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ as part of the ‘Rage Boyz Crew’. On March 9, 2010, the band released their first five-track EP titled ‘Ready Set Rock’. The EP was self-released and did not have the backing of any major brand. However, the band later removed the EP after Ross was selected for the role of Austin Moon on Disney Channel series ‘Austin & Ally’.</p><p>In 2010, Lynch played a small role in the short film ‘NASA: Exploration Space – Explorers Wanted’. Later, in 2013, he appeared in the episode ‘Get Down on It’ of the TV series ‘Wedding Band’ as Just’a Krush Member.</p><p>R5 was signed by Hollywood Records in April 2012. In May, they started their debut tour, the ‘West Coast Tour’, and in December, they went on their second tour, the ‘East Coast Tour’. In late 2012, they collaborated with a bunch of other artists on the charity single ‘Make Some Noise’ for Family Channel’s philanthropic campaign ‘Stand Up’.</p><p>On February 19, 2013, they released the EP ‘Loud’, containing four songs. On the day of its release, the EP peaked at number 7 on the iTunes chart on overall sales and ranked 3rd on the Pop albums chart. The band released their debut album ‘Louder’ on September 24, 2013. The album surpassed their debut EP and ranked at number 2 on the iTunes chart.</p><p>It was also named a ‘chart-topper’ on the iTunes ‘End of the Year’ albums list. R5 members embarked on a worldwide tour in late 2013 to support their debut album ‘Louder’. For over six months, they held shows in various venues throughout Asia, Europe, Central America, Canada, and the United States.</p><p>The third EP of the band, ‘Heart Made Up on You’, was released on July 22, 2014. The EP contained the songs ‘Heart Made Up on You’, ‘Things Are Looking Up’, ‘Easy Love’, and ‘Stay With Me’, all of which were received with positive reviews.
