Net Worth, NBA Contracts & Fine & Suspensions</h2><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>“Greek Freak,” Giannis Antetokounmpo’s net worth as of December 2023 is a whopping <strong>$70 million</strong>.</p><p>Just like any other NBA player, Giannis earns money primarily through his NBA salaries, incentives, and bonuses.</p><p>Nonetheless, what’s uncommon about Giannis is that he is signed to the Bucks in the largest contract ever in NBA history.</p><p>Aside from that, he also makes money from endorsement deals and business pursuits.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Antetokounmpo earns at least <strong>$20 million</strong> per year on average from his various brand deals.</p><p>Moreover, he has appeared on Forbes’s list of highest-earning athletes several times over the years, with tens of millions of dollars in annual income.</p><p>His income was <strong>$35 million</strong> between June 2017 and June 2018 which he made through NBA salaries and endorsement deals.</p><p>Similarly, Antetokounmpo earned <strong>$43 million</strong> between June 2018 and June 2019.</p><p>With each passing year, Giannis has been able to outperform himself in comparison to the previous year, which has not only helped him in upping his career records but also fattening his bank balance with greens.</p><p>With earnings of<strong> $47.6 million</strong>, he was ranked 55th on the Forbes list of Celebrity 100 in 2020.</p><p>That year he earned<strong> $19.6 million</strong> in NBA salaries and <strong>$28 million</strong> from endorsements.</p><p>In 2022, Giannis featured on the Forbes list of highest-paid athletes in the tenth spot with total earnings of a staggering <strong>$80.9 million.</strong></p><p>Out of his total earnings, <strong>$39.9 million</strong> came from NBA salary, while <strong>$41 million</strong> came off the court.</p><h3>NBA Contracts</h3><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks 15th overall in the first round of the 2013 NBA Draft.</p><p>The same year he was signed to four years <strong>$8,615,141</strong> rookie contract with the Bucks with an average annual salary of <strong>$2,153,785.</strong></p><p>The deal also ensured <strong>$3,665,760</strong> guaranteed at the sign.</p><p>Giannis became a free agent in 2017, which did not last long as Bucks offered him a bird extension the same year.</p><p>This four-year contract was worth a staggering <strong>$100 million</strong> and came with all the bells and whistles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GiannisAntetokunmpo.jpg><p>It paid Giannis an annual salary of <strong>$25 million, </strong>and the entire amount of<strong> $100 million</strong> was guaranteed at the sign.</p><p>However, still, Giannis’s big payday was yet to come.</p><p>After the bird extension expired in 2021, Giannis signed a supermax extension with the Milwaukee Bucks.</p><p>The 5-year / <strong>$228,200,420</strong> extension became the largest contract ever in NBA history, dwarfing every other contract ever signed.</p><p>It still is the largest active contract in the NBA.</p><p>The extension guaranteed Giannis the entire amount of <strong>$228,200,420</strong> at the sign, with an average annual salary of <strong>$45,640,084.</strong></p><p>In the 2022-23 season, he will earn a base salary of <strong>$42,492,492</strong>&nbsp;while carrying a cap hit of <strong>$42,492,492</strong> and a dead cap value of <strong>$42,492,492.</strong></p><p>Similarly, he will earn an annual salary of <strong>$45,640,084</strong> in 2023-24, and <strong>$48,787,676</strong> in 2024-25.</p><p>Moreover, his 2025-26 season salary with the team will be a staggering <strong>$51,935,268.</strong></p><p>To date, Giannis has earned <strong>$146,344,870</strong> from NBA salary alone, which will hike to<strong> $335,200,390</strong> once his supermax extension with the Bucks matures in 2026.</p><h3>Fines and Suspensions</h3><p>Giannis is a big guy and has fouled the fellow players out of rage or unknowingly on several occasions over the years.</p><p>And we are aware that each time a player fouls, he forfeits the money.</p><p>So to date, 6 feet 11 inches giant has forfeited <strong>$261,989</strong> and received two-game suspensions.</p><p>In 2015, he received a one-game suspension and forfeited <strong>$17,763</strong> for shoving Mike Dunleavy during the CHI-MIL game (playoff)</p><p>Similarly, on August 12, 2020, Giannis received another game suspension and forfeited <strong>$178,226</strong> for head-butting Mo Wagner (WAS).</p><p>Aside from that, he has been charged with ejection and
