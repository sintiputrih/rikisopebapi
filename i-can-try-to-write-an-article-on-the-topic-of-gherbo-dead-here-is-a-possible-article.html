The article claimed that Herbert Wright III, better known by his stage name G Herbo, was shot and killed in his home in Chicago. It also said that witnesses saw two men leave in a black SUV after the shooting.</p><p>The article quickly went viral on social media, with many fans and celebrities expressing their condolences and disbelief. However, some people noticed that the website was not a credible source of news, and that the article had no author, date, or evidence to support its claim. In fact, Channel 45 News is a prank website that allows users to create fake news stories and share them online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Truth</h2><p>G Herbo is not dead. He is alive and well, and has been active on his Instagram and Twitter accounts since the hoax. He has not addressed the rumor directly, but he has posted several photos and videos of himself and his family, showing that he is in good spirits and health.</p><p>G Herbo is a popular rapper from Chicago, who rose to fame with his mixtapes Welcome to Fazoland (2014), Pistol P Project (2014), and Ballin Like I’m Kobe (2015). He is also known for his collaborations with Nicki Minaj, 21 Savage, Lil Bibby, and Southside. He released his debut studio album, Humble Beast, in 2017, and his second album, Swervo, in 2018. He is currently working on his third album, PTSD, which is expected to be released in 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Reaction</h2><p>Many fans and celebrities were relieved to find out that G Herbo is not dead, and that the article was a hoax. They criticized the prank website for spreading false information and playing with people’s emotions. They also praised G Herbo for his music and his resilience, and expressed their support and love for him.</p><p>Some of the celebrities who reacted to the hoax include:</p><ul><li>21 Savage: “Glad you good bro love you for life @nolimitherbo”</li><li>Lil Bibby: “Stop playing with my brother name @nolimitherbo”</li><li>Lil Durk: “They can’t stop us @nolimitherbo”</li><li>Lil Reese: “Fake ass news @nolimitherbo ain’t going nowhere”</li><li>Lil Uzi Vert: “G Herbo the goat @nolimitherbo”</li></ul><p>G Herbo has not responded to the hoax or the reactions, but he has continued to share his music and his life with his fans. He recently posted a video of him performing at a concert, with the caption: “PTSD TOUR COMING SOON”. He also posted a photo of him with his son, with the caption: “MY REASON”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfnnqkrc1mq6uxXam8bsPRoqueZZGjeqK%2B06KapZ1dpLtuwMeeZK2noJ6wbrvFZp6hnaKXvG6wxJqbZqCVp7JutdJmmGaon6jAqq7LnmSaqqSesK2xjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-perth-a-nice-place-to-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Perth a nice place to live?">&larr;
