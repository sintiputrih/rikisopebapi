As of now, Clairo is <strong>single</strong> and enjoying her life.</p><p>In an interview, she explained that making friends in college is what helped her to come out as they were openly gay and she was inspired by “their confidence and their willingness to be exposed”.</p><p>She is more focused on her singing career than being in a relationship. Whenever she is not singing or writing songs, Clairo keeps her busy studying and spending time with her family and friends.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Talking about her presence on the social media platform, Claire is quite active there. She loves interacting with her fans and followers.</p><p>She has an Instagram account and a Twitter account. On <strong>Instagram,</strong> she has 2.8 million and on Twitter, she has 502.3 K followers.</p><p>Being a successful singer, she has her own YouTube channel where she uploads all her hard work and her creations. On YouTube, she has 1.54 million subscribers.</p><h2><span id=Clairo_8211_Professional_Life>Clairo – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Claire Cottrill began recording covers at the age of 13; she often performed covers at local businesses including Blue Dry Goods.</p><p>During this time, MTV contacted her to record a song to be used as background music for one of their shows, but the song was never in use. She recalled that the Shins’ Wincing the Night Away was “the first album I completely geeked out over” crediting it as her inspiration to make music.</p><p>Based on the fact that many around her told her that a music career was unlikely she did not consider it a likely prospect and musically “kind of did whatever I wanted”.</p><p>Under the names Clairo and DJ Baby Benz, she began posting music to Bandcamp while attending Concord-Carlisle High School and went on to post covers and songs in addition to DJ mixes of rap music on SoundCloud.</p><p>She also maintained a YouTube channel where she would post covers and short films. Clairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song “Pretty Girl” went viral on YouTube.</p><p>The song was being recorded for an indie rock compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center.</p><p>According to her, she recorded the track “using the resources around me which were pretty shitty. I used to like a little keyboard that I had and I was really into ’80s pop music — my mom is obsessed with it — so it kind of inspired me to do something like that”.</p><p>She attributed to interest in the video to YouTube’s algorithm system. The video became popular on vaporwave-centric Facebook groups.</p><p>Another that was uploaded to YouTube a month earlier, “Flamin Hot Cheetos”, garnered 3 million views by July 2018.</p><p>The success of “Pretty Girl” led to interest from major labels such as Capitol, RCA, and Columbia.</p><h4><span>More about her career</span></h4><p>Jon Cohen, the co-founder of The Fader, signed Clairo to the magazine’s associated record label with a 12-song record contract and introduced her to Pat Corcoran, manager of Chance the Rapper.</p><p>She became a client of the talent agency Haight Brand near the end of 2017. On May 25, 2018, Fader Label released Clairo’s debut record, titled Diary 001.</p><p>In her review for Pitchfork, Fader contributor Sasha Geffen wrote that the EP ought to subside the “legions of naysayers who dismissed her as a one-hit fluke or an industry plant”.</p><p>A piece written by Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times said that the work: “bridges both worlds, building on the coy, understated bedroom pop of ‘Pretty Girl’ and ‘Flamin Hot Cheetos’ toward sturdier numbers like ‘4EVER’ and ‘B.O.M.D.'”.</p><p>That same month she announced a headlining tour throughout North America, opening for Dua Lipa. Her July performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New Year was a sold-out show.</p><p>In October 2018, she performed at Lollapalooza. She performed at Coachella in 2019.

As of 2019, Mike Ahern and Jimmy Bui were managing Clairo.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-86516 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Clairo-performing-on-a-show.jpg alt=Clairo width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-86516 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Clairo performing on a show (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_2024>Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>The talented singer has a <strong>net worth</strong> of around $100,000.
