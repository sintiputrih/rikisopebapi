After a single film he co-directed in the 1930s, he moved to America and began making movies there, finding success in the 1940s and further acclaim throughout the '50s and '60s. His output slowed during the '70s, his final film came out in 1981, and Wilder himself ended up living to the age of 95, passing away in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He left behind a remarkable filmography, and one that - unlike some directors active during cinema's earlier years - survives in totality to this day. He has 27 directorial credits to his name, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but one of those films</a> was <a href=#>a war documentary</a> that's hard to include and rank among his other feature films. As such, what follows is a ranking of the 26 feature films he directed (and often wrote or co-wrote), <strong>starting with his lesser - though still decent - films and ending with his masterpieces</strong>.</p><h2 id=39-the-emperor-waltz-39-1948><span class=item-num>26 </span><span>'The Emperor Waltz' (1948)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-bing-crosby-joan-fontaine-roland-culver>Starring: Bing Crosby, Joan Fontaine, Roland Culver</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-emperor-waltz-1948.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The Emperor Waltz</strong> is an oddity within the filmography of Billy Wilder, and has a shot at being deemed the most obscure film the director ever made (were that to ever be a competition for whatever reason). It’s <a href=#>an old-fashioned and somewhat awkward musical</a>, centering on a traveling salesman during the early 1900s trying to persuade an emperor to buy a gramophone.</p><p>It’s been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested that Billy Wilder didn’t look favorably</a> on this film, and the consensus from looking at user ratings on sites like IMDb and Letterboxd backs this dissatisfaction up. The Emperor Waltz is <strong>not a total disaster by any means, still being well-presented overall</strong> and featuring some decent star power thanks to the likes of <strong>Bing Crosby</strong> and <strong>Joan Fontaine</strong> in the lead roles, but it’s far from an essential Billy Wilder film, at the end of the day.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Buy on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=39-buddy-buddy-39-1981><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>'Buddy Buddy' (1981)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-jack-lemmon-walter-matthau-paula-prentiss>Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Paula Prentiss</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buddy-buddy-1981.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Buddy Buddy</strong> was the final film Billy Wilder ever directed, and though it wasn’t a total misfire, it does stand as an example of the filmmaker potentially being on autopilot, or close to it. The premise sees two mismatched people brought together due to unusual circumstances: one a contract killer staying in a hotel, and the other a man also in the same hotel who’s distraught over his marital problems.</p><p><strong>It was one of many movies starring <a href=#>the iconic comedy duo</a> of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau</strong>, the pair best known for movies like <strong>The Odd Couple</strong> and <strong>Grumpy Old Men</strong>. It was also the third time the pair had collaborated together with Wilder as director, and one of many times Wilder worked with Lemmon. Those who like comedic crime movies or the duo of Lemmon and Matthau may find value within Buddy Buddy, but it’s otherwise probably skippable for most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Buy on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=39-bad-seed-39-1934><span class=item-num>24 </span><span>'Bad Seed' (1934)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-danielle-darrieux-pierre-mingand-raymond-galle>Starring: Danielle Darrieux, Pierre Mingand, Raymond Galle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bad-seed-1934.jpg><p>From 1981’s Buddy Buddy, the final Billy Wilder film, to 1934’s <strong>Bad Seed</strong>, which was his first movie, and also the only one he co-directed (with <strong>Alexander Esway</strong>) and <strong>the only film of his to be shot in a language other than English</strong>. In this instance, it’s a French movie made before Wilder went to Hollywood, and follows the exploits of a young man starved for cash, and thereby becomes incentivized to join a gang of car thieves.</p><p><a href=#>There are plenty of great French crime movies</a>, but Bad Seed isn’t quite one of them, though admittedly, it’s not too bad considering its age. It might be worth a watch for those who consider themselves rather passionate Wilder fans, given this film has his earliest directorial credit. Also, the fact it only runs for 77 minutes means it won’t waste too much of anyone’s time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on MUBI</a></span></p><h2 id=39-fedora-39-1978><span class=item-num>23 </span><span>'Fedora' (1978)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-william-holden-marthe-keller-hildegard-knef>Starring: William Holden, Marthe Keller, Hildegard Knef</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fedora-1978.jpg><p>Billy Wilder’s penultimate film was 1978’s <strong>Fedora</strong>, and it ended up being <a href=#>one of his more subdued and dramatic works</a>.

There’s value here in <strong>seeing an aging filmmaker using one of his films to look back on the industry he worked within for decades</strong>, but for the most part, the movie really is just decent.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Buy on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-spirit-of-st-louis-39-1957><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>'The Spirit of St. Louis' (1957)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-james-stewart-murray-hamilton-patricia-smith>Starring: James Stewart, Murray Hamilton, Patricia Smith</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-spirit-of-st-louis-1957-1.jpg><p>Somewhat uncharacteristic of Billy Wilder, <strong>The Spirit of St. Louis</strong> showed what <strong>the filmmaker was <a href=#>capable of making within the biopic genre</a></strong>.

Wilder captures the man’s life and focuses on this particular achievement of his in a way that’s relatively compelling (<strong>James Stewart</strong> is also reliably good in the lead role), though the film never truly or spectacularly soars, unfortunately, despite its high-flying narrative.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent on Apple TV</a></span></p><h2 id=39-kiss-me-stupid-39-1964><span class=item-num>21 </span><span>'Kiss Me, Stupid' (1964)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-dean-martin-kim-novak-ray-walston>Starring: Dean Martin, Kim Novak, Ray Walston</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kim-novak-in-kiss-me-stupid.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On paper, <strong>Kiss Me, Stupid</strong> does sound like it should – or could – be something of a Billy Wilder classic, but it ultimately falls a little short of greatness (while still being an alright watch). It sees the filmmaker right in his wheelhouse, given this is a blend of romance and comedy genres that dealt with some fairly risqué things for its time, and much of Wilder’s late ‘50s and early ‘60s works were defined by these sorts of traits.</p><p>It's ultimately a farcical story that involves lounge singers, songwriters, call girls, and disgruntled wives, <strong>all thrown into a comedic blender and generating some – but not quite enough – laughs along the way</strong>. Wilder at least assembled a good cast for what ended up being a decent movie, with <strong>Dean Martin</strong> and <strong>Kim Novak</strong> (<a href=#>of <strong>Alfred Hitchcock’s</strong><strong>Vertigo</strong> fame</a>) doing their best to give Kiss Me, Stupid some extra energy, and kind of succeeding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Hoopla</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-private-life-of-sherlock-holmes-39-1970><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' (1970)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-robert-stephens-colin-blakely-genevi-egrave-ve-page>Starring: Robert Stephens, Colin Blakely, Geneviève Page</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-private-life-of-sherlock-holmes-1970.jpg><p>There’s no shortage of <a href=#><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong></a> adaptations <a href=#>within the world of film and television</a>, and not even Billy Wilder could resist putting his own spin on the classic detective character. <strong>The result was the flawed yet still underrated The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</strong>, which feels like a more comedic and even surreal take on the titular character than one might expect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The humor and surprises found within The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes make it worth digging out, and it’s one of many compellingly written movies that Wilder co-wrote with his frequent collaborator <strong>I. A. L. Diamond</strong>. It might not please Sherlock Holmes purists, and it’s definitely a little messier than the films that showcase Wilder at his best, but it’s still a good bit of fun and an overall easy-to-appreciate movie.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Tubi</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-front-page-39-1974><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>'The Front Page' (1974)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-jack-lemmon-walter-matthau-susan-sarandon>Starring: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Susan Sarandon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-front-page-1974.jpg><p>Seven years before Buddy Buddy, Billy Wilder directed both Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in <strong>The Front Page</strong>, which ended up being the director’s third-last movie.

The Front Page has a relatively simple premise, but this works in its favor, as it’s a straightforward, mostly enjoyable, and very much unpretentious comedy with two legendary funnymen in the starring roles.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-seven-year-itch-39-1955><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>'The Seven Year Itch' (1955)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-marilyn-monroe-tom-ewell-evelyn-keyes>Starring: Marilyn Monroe, Tom Ewell, Evelyn Keyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/marilyn-monroe-in-the-seven-year-itch.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going by pop culture, <strong>The Seven Year Itch</strong> could be up there with Billy Wilder’s most influential and well-known movies, considering the scene within it that features <strong>Marilyn Monroe’s</strong> dress being blown up by a passing subway train. Everyone’s likely seen at least a still image of that scene, but it’s one small part of a movie that, overall, works pretty well, even if it’s not entirely a classic.</p><p>The Seven Year Itch follows a <a href=#>pretty unlikable protagonist going through a midlife crisis</a>, and he’s not quite as well-written as other flawed yet compelling main characters from Wilder’s better movies. Monroe is good for what she’s given, <strong>but her best work with Wilder would be shown in another movie later in the 1950s</strong> (it’ll be outlined all in good time). The Seven Year Itch is a good Wilder film, but not quite a great one, and it might not be as well-remembered if it weren’t for that subway/dress scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Tubi</a></span></p><h2 id=39-love-in-the-afternoon-39-1957><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>'Love in the Afternoon' (1957)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-gary-cooper-audrey-hepburn-maurice-chevalier>Starring: Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn, Maurice Chevalier</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/love-in-the-afternoon-1957.jpg><p>Billy Wilder had a big year in 1957, considering there were three films of his that came out during those 12 months, and all belonged to different genres.

Walter Matthau also shows up here, perhaps not too surprisingly, and this was not only the first time Wilder, Lemmon, and Matthau all collaborated as a trio, but also the first time (of many) that Lemmon and Matthau starred in a film together as a duo.</p><p>Plot-wise, The Fortune Cookie revolves around an injured man’s brother-in-law deciding to start a civil case out of the incident, given he’s a lawyer with a tendency to ambulance chase. Things unravel in a farcical manner, and <strong>the results prove very entertaining, especially if you’re a fan of old-school Hollywood comedies</strong>. It’s one of the looser and more chaotic entries in Wilder’s filmography, but such qualities ultimately help make The Fortune Cookie as entertaining as it is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-major-and-the-minor-39-1942><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>'The Major and the Minor' (1942)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-ginger-rogers-ray-milland-rita-johnson>Starring: Ginger Rogers, Ray Milland, Rita Johnson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/the-major-and-the-minor-1942.jpg><p>Billy Wilder’s first American movie and the first he was the sole director of was <strong>The Major and the Minor</strong>, an engaging comedy <a href=#>starring <strong>Ginger Rogers</strong> (minus <strong>Fred Astaire</strong>, though)</a>.

Like that film, Irma la Douce is another romantic comedy, here set in Paris and centering on a police officer who falls in love with a prostitute, and then, because of his frenzied love, goes to desperate lengths to stop her from seeing the kinds of clients she used to see.</p><p>The most admirable thing about Irma la Douce is how daring it was by the standards of the 1960s, helping to push American cinema forward and become less restricted. It’s also notable for causing a mix-up on Oscar night, albeit one not quite as <a href=#>drastic as the <strong>La La Land</strong>/<strong>Moonlight</strong> mix-up</a> 50+ years later, which involved MacLaine’s brother, <strong>Warren Beatty</strong>. Unfortunately, the bloated runtime of Irma la Douce (nearly 2.5 hours!) stops it from being an undisputed classic, though there’s more than enough good here to ensure it’s worth a watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Hoopla</a></span></p><h2 id=39-stalag-17-39-1953><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'Stalag 17' (1953)</span></h2><h3 id=starring-robert-strauss-william-holden-don-taylor>Starring: Robert Strauss, William Holden, Don Taylor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-strauss-william-holden-and-harvey-lembeck-in-stalag-17.jpg><p><strong>While Stalag 17 is, on the surface, <a href=#>a movie about prisoners of war</a>, it does manage to be surprisingly funny</strong> for a film within such a genre.

But in our current universe/timeline, Ace in the Hole is bleak and ostensibly a drama, yet a gripping one that’s aged surprisingly well.
