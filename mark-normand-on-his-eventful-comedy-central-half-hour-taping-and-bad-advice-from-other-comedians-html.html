For years now, he’s labored through open mics all across the city, played shows to half-filled rooms and drunk, distracted patrons, spent hours enticing passers-by to free comedy shows in the West Village, and balanced multiple careers, a relationship, and a social life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40w9hunmccuch1r26@published data-word-count=55>But all of these have not been for nothing. Normand is now a Comedy Cellar regular, has appeared on <i>Conan</i>, <i>Last Comic Standing</i>, and <i>Inside Amy Schumer</i>. Most recently, Normand finally assembled his first album, <i>Still Got It,</i> and filmed his first Comedy Central special for their series <i>The Half Hour</i>, which debuts this Friday.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40w9iunmcfp8g2sr7@published data-word-count=30>Normand and I chatted about some of the difficulties of capturing the sets, a deeply inopportune bout of food poisoning, and some of the worst advice he has ever received.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40w9junmc49nsbuey@published data-word-count=15><b>Let’s begin with your CD, <i>Still Got It</i>.

The title is because I always say it to people; it’s a bullshit term that I think is funny. When somebody bombs, they come off stage and you go, “Hey, you still got it!” It’s a weird term, because I think people buy into it a little bit. At first they go, “Oh, really? Oh… fuck you.” So it’s kind of a fun thing to say. I say it on people’s birthdays. Every birthday on Facebook, I go, “Hey, happy birthday! Still got it!” And people are so delusional that sometimes they go “Oh you think so? Thanks!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40w9lunmccsx29r7r@published data-word-count=13><b>Was it one continuous set or was it a compilation of scattered ones?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40w9munmc0g22j9em@published data-word-count=43>I did two sets that I kind of spliced together; whatever reaction was better.

Nate Bargatze, Sean Patton, and Tommy Johnagin were like, “You’re doing an album?

They were amazing; we sold out every show, which I’ve never done because I’m not a draw.

I’m not a Louis C.K. kind of guy. I still have to run that — you know, when I’m doing a show, no one knows who I am, so I have to gain their respect and trust. So I’ve got to do some of that A [material]. But once the new stuff starts kicking in, I just have to keep working, keep working a new 10&nbsp;or 20, and then get it to a 30&nbsp;and then a 40.

Although, two things did happen: First, two guys perform each night, so this guy went before me and then I went second and while he was on, I opened a door and the fire alarm came on like <i>woo woo woo woo</i>. I was like, “Ah shit!” and everybody’s freaking out because it’s a taping. I ran down the stairs <span style=color:#545454>—</span>&nbsp;like I don’t want them to know it was me <span style=color:#545454>— a</span>nd I hid for like 20 minutes behind a counter. Then they figured it all out and got the noise to stop. I was walking around like, “What was that all about?” And then cut to me going on stage, I’m doing great, I finish, I wrap up, I go, “Thanks a lot, all right.” And they go, “You’ve got to redo the first three minutes. We put the wrong name on the backdrop.” I’m like, “What the hell? You put the wrong name on the backdrop? I’ve got to redo it? All the magic is gone! They already heard all the jokes.” And they’re like, “Well, you set off the fire alarm so now we’re even.” I was like, “Ah shit, they knew it was me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wa2unmcm03kr7yx@published data-word-count=6><b>How was the second time around?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wa3unmcfsq88o8y@published data-word-count=75>Oh it was awful. I was sweating, and I made some jokes about it … like I just started but I was already sweating. I had to re-tell the jokes, and they got 40% of what they got the first time because they’re like, “We know these jokes now.” So it was kind of awkward … I hope the power and the magic of editing comes through, because it will be awkward if it doesn’t.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wa4unmc59qk96rt@published data-word-count=23><b>That’s painful.

I remember moving to New York thinking that anyone with a half hour’s got a mansion and a yacht and eight supermodels. And then you’re in New York living in a shoebox and masturbating to music videos. Not much has changed; you’re on the road and you get a little more respect from the other guys, but it’s just a job, man. That’s just one of the stepping stones in a comedy career. Now it’s like, what’s the next thing? Now I want the hour. You think you get <i>The Half Hour,&nbsp;</i>and you’re like, “All right, I’m retiring, give me my giant check,” but it’s all just more work to go, buddy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wa6unmcoi3krafr@published data-word-count=10><b>Do you get more people recognizing you at this point?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wa7unmcuzpnc927@published data-word-count=39>Not really.

It really crushed me because I was a big fan of his like three years ago and then I said, “Ah fuck it, he’s the one with the stupid delivery.” He was just drunk and projecting. I don’t know; I get a lot of people who say, “You should say it differently” or “You have a weird rhythm.” People are always giving me tips, but I think the delivery I have is different. You want to stand out, but on the other hand stupid people go, “Hey, you don’t want to stand out. You’re doing it wrong.” No, I’m not doing it wrong; I’m just doing it like everyone else.

You’re oppressing <i>me</i> now.” That was really annoying. Oh man, I’ve gotten such bad advice. A guy told me to move around more. He’s like, “You’ve gotta use the whole stage!” I was like, “Why?

Judd Apatow’s directing it, which is terrifying because he was giving me notes on shit and he’s the guy who did <i>40-Year-Old Virgin</i>, <i>Knocked Up</i>, giving me notes like “Don’t say that, say this! Try that again, that wasn’t funny. How about this? Try this!” And you’re like, “Okay I’m sorry, don’t hate me! You’re a legend, I’m terrified.” I have one line.

I learned a lot and it was cool to go through, but movies just stress me out especially when I have no control. It’s like “Okay, you guys figure it out. Just tell me what to do. I don’t want to be here.” It’s a huge multi-million dollar production and you feel like you’re gonna fuck it up. I felt like I would step backwards and a chain of events would cause the camera to slip and a light would tip over and hit a lady in the head and she’d wobble over to a thing and that would fall and the whole set would fall down.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40wapunmc4kebkzyv@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qrgh40waqunmcqs7at8eh@published data-word-count=18><i><a href=#>Phil Stamato</a>&nbsp;lives and writes in New York, where he may also be seen standing up and telling jokes.</i></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Mark Normand on His Eventful Comedy Central ‘Half […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgbHyurdGkZKenoqKur7CMqKVmoJmoeqbCxKern62cYrCwucSdsGablaPBs63LZp%2BapJZitbDB0WarmqiZo7Rurc2dZJuZlGKupcLInJxmnqKkum6706Gcq2WTpLqmsMiapaxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicole-kidman-white-tee-for-travel-8420394.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicole Kidman Wore the Best Closet Basic Everyone Should Have">&larr;
