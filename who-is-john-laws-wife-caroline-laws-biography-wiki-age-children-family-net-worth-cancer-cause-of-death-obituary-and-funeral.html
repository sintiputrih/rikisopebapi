Her death was announced on Monday, February 24, 2020, in a statement during the 2SM radio show usually presented by her husband. The statement said, “It is with a heavy heart, we announce this morning the sad passing of Caroline Laws, beloved wife of legendary Australian broadcaster John Laws. ‘The Princess’, as she was lovingly referred to by John, had bravely fought cancer for a number of years.”</p><p>“John first met the love of his life at the tender age of 16. At the time Caroline was 14, and they met at a dance at a mutual friend’s Lindfield home in around 1951. They re-united some 20 years later and married in November 1976. At the time John told The Australian Women’s Weekly, ‘I loved her the moment I saw her’. Together John and Caroline lived a life that revolved around their consuming love for one-another. This love and life extended to their nine children who added a beautiful joy within their blended extended family. John referred to Caroline as his greatest confidant – doting upon her to his devoted listeners across Australia.</p><p>“On behalf of Mr Bill Caralis, the John Laws team, his colleagues at The Super Radio Network, and for those of us within the wider Australian radio industry – we extend our deepest condolences to John Laws and his family at this sad time. Vale Caroline Laws – you will be forever loved by all.”</p><p>2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley, who began his career under Laws at 2UE, paid tribute to Caroline during his show on Monday [February 24, 2020] and offered his condolences to John.</p><p>“She was an extremely elegant and delightful lady, and it would be impossible to even comprehend what John’s going through at the moment. I offer, with everyone else, our sincere condolences on the loss of his beautiful wife.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=caroline-laws-cause-of-death></span> Caroline Laws Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caroline Laws’ cause of death was cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=caroline-laws-cancer></span> Caroline Laws Cancer<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caroline was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2016 after a routine check-up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjpqGmXaGuuL%2BMsKCfnV2YrrO7y6KlnmWclsS0ecGipqCqkaW1unnWoqKiZZGcsm6vx6KjnaqVo3qnrcyio7JlnprBbsPOq6uhZZOWu6Sx0Waamq2jmnqwsoydnJqsmGK8o7XTrpirsV2Wu6V5xa6lnqqRoXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./janelle-monae-19851201-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Astrology Birth Chart of Janelle Monae (Soul Singer) 2024">&larr;
