Ruby is a well-known actress in German theatre.</strong></p><p>Schweighofer, a German actor, has had a fruitful career thus far, which has led to him accomplishing a lot. Because he was born into a family of actors, he rapidly came to the conclusion that his place should be in front of the camera.</p><p>Later on, he participated in the theatre club at his high school in Chemnitz, Germany, and he credits his parents, Gitta Schweighofer and Michael Schweighofer, for his success in the club. His parents are both theatre artists, and they frequently brought him to some of their rehearsals.</p><p>After completing his education, he uprooted his life and relocated to Berlin, where he has been residing since since. His first performance was in the film picture Changing Skins, which was released in 1997 and was directed by Andreas Dresen. Another one of his projects, You Are Wanted, which was also the first German-language Amazon Original Series, was one that he produced, directed, and starred in (2017). The first season was made available in more than 200 countries and six languages around the world.</p><p>Schweighofer directed the film Army of Thieves, which starred Ruby O. Fee, who is currently dating the 41-year-old actor who goes by the name Ruby and who he has been dating.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Matthias-Schweighofer--300x300.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-90338 alt="Matthias Schweighöfer" width=460 height=460 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-90338 class=wp-caption-text>Matthias Schweighöfer</p><h2 id=matthias-schweighofer-is-dating-girlfriend-ruby-o-fee><span id=Matthias_Schweighofer_Is_Dating_Girlfriend_Ruby_OFee>Matthias Schweighöfer Is Dating Girlfriend Ruby O.Fee<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-showbizcast_com-medrectangle-4-0 class="ezoic-ad ezfound" data-google-query-id=CK3ghOvm0_sCFQed_Qcd5qYJ3g></span></span></h2><p>Over the course of more than three years, Matthias Schweighofer has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Ruby O. Fee. Both Matthias and Ruby have a career in acting.</p><p>Ruby, a German television personality who was born in Costa Rica, is most recognised for her role as Sophie Kellermann in the children’s television series 13 Hours: Race Against Time. The part of Sophia v. Gelenberg, which Ruby played in the Bibi and Tina movie series, is primarily responsible for her widespread fame.</p><p>Because she has appeared in a variety of media in Europe, including kid’s movies, advertisements, historical plays, and more, O. Fee is a well-known face in that region. She is also making a name for herself in the entertainment industry, specifically in Hollywood.</p><p>The Costa Rican actress made her debut in a feature film with the role of Rebecca in the English movie Womb, which also starred Eva Green and Matt Smith. Ruby, then nine years old, was found by photographers working for a children’s fashion magazine while she was residing in a small village in Brazil with her mother. Ruby was living in the village with her mother.</p><p>After that, she found that she couldn’t get enough time in front of the camera and began pleading with her mother to sign her up with an acting agency. Ruby was successful in convincing her mother to support her acting career.</p><p>Ruby’s part in Zack Snyder’s film Army of Thieves came to an end in 2021. Snyder was the film’s director. She appears alongside her lover Matthia in the film playing the role of the hacker Korina.</p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;Is Jacob Latimore and Serayah Still Together?
