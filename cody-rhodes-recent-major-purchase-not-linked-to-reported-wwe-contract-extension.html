He is still huge money in the merchandise department, and fans can’t wait to yell his “WOAH” at the top of their lungs during his entrance. That being said, his contract situation is a bit of a mystery at the present moment.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously reported that WWE</a> really wanted to lock Cody Rhodes down with long-term contract. <a href=#>That big money deal was then reportedly not signed just yet</a>. Still, he acquired a new bus for the road, and that led to many assuming a deal was locked in.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall during his Backstage Report podcast that Cody Rhodes was actually trying to get that bus long before any report of a contract extension. So, this was not a part of a reported new deal, although a lot of people thought it was connected.</p><p>Now I want to clarify some things there is an amount provided that covers a bus, which is a life-changer as I understand as far as pro wrestling travel. However, that isn’t necessarily a part of the contract, a bus, so Cody Rhodes ended up getting a new bus and that led to many talent assuming he signed a new deal. Many talent thought that, and I was told that they were trying to get that bus long before they actually got it.</p><p>The Big Show once credited traveling via bus to extending his pro wrestling career by a decade, or longer. It helps with the wear and tear on the road, no matter the size of the Superstar. This makes bus travel so essential for Superstars, but it is a costly investment.</p><p>We will have to see how much longer Cody Rhodes is in WWE. He still has WrestleMania glory in his eyes, even though The Rock’s recent return to WWE marked a very interesting swerve in his story.</p><p>What’s your take on Cody Rhodes sticking around WWE? Should he bet on himself again and leave for another few years?
