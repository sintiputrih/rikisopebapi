She has been active since as far back as 1994, giving her about three decades worth of experience in front of the camera. She rose to prominence as a teenager for her critically acclaimed performance in the gothic drama Eve’s Bayou, and has since gone on to star in several notable movies and TV shows, including Cousin Skeeter, Think Like a Man, and is currently winning over more fans for her role as Camille in Harlem.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Good returns to the silver screen with a more fleshed out role as the superhero Darla in Shazam! Future of the Gods, which will be released on March 17. Before then, for a chance to catch, or rewatch some of her older projects, here are Meagan Good’s 10 best movies and TV shows, ranked from least to best.</p><h2 id=h-10-d-e-b-s data-injectable=false>10. D.E.B.S.</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Despite the mixed reviews and its underperforming at the box office, D.E.B.S. has gained a loyal following, with fans still rewatching the cult classic two decades later. The 2004 spy-comedy stars Devon Aoki, Sara Foster, Jill Ritchie, and Good as members of an elite squad of spies-in-training who must take down a ruthless villain, played by Jordana Brewster. Directed by Angela Robinson, D.E.B.S. is a fun action-comedy with enough campy moments to keep any viewer entertained.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Deliver Us From Eva</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>Deliver Us from Eva stars LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union in lead roles, while Good takes on a supporting role alongside Essence Atkins, Duane Martin, Robinne Lee, and Mel Jackson. The romantic comedy follows the perfectionist Evangeline Dandridge, who constantly interferes in the romantic affairs of her three sisters. The only way out seems to be to pay a notorious playboy to date her and keep her occupied, and Eva finds herself swept up in an unexpected romance. The film didn’t score too well with critics, but remains a Black household staple and favorite in the rom-com genre.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. The Intruder</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>Paired alongside Michael Ealy in this psychological thriller, Good stars as Annie Howard, a woman who moves into a new home with her husband after buying it from the previous owner, Charlie Peck. Things start out pretty good after the purchase, but the film quickly spirals into a case of obsession, as Charlie refuses to let the house go, which torments its new owners. Dennis Quaid stars as Charlie, and the film received mixed reviews.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Stomp the Yard</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>Stomp the Yard became a fan-favorite dance film upon its release in 2007.

Stomp the Yard follows a college student at a HBCU who joins a fraternity to compete in a major step dance competition after his brother is murdered. The film features exciting dance numbers and became a box office hit, grossing over $75 million against a budget of $13 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Cousin Skeeter</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=true>In one of her earliest roles, Good rose to fame as Nina Jones in the popular Nickelodeon sitcom Cousin Skeeter, which ran from 1998 until 2001. The show, which was mainly targeted at adolescents, features the titular character who moves into his cousin Bobby’s house, and along with Nina, navigate life, school, and more together. Cousin Skeeter was credited for boosting young Black representation on television, and proved a major success for Nickelodeon during its run.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Deception</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=908 data-injectable=true>&nbsp;Good starred in this short-lived and under-appreciated soap opera as an undercover detective named Joanna Locasto. Deception follows the death of a wealthy heiress named Vivian, whose death is ruled a suicide, but raises the eyebrows of FBI agents Will Moreno and Joanna. The latter infiltrates her former friend’s family in an attempt to uncover the secrets behind her death, but old and new secrets rise to the surface to jeopardize the entire mission. Deception ran for only one season and 11 episodes on NBC, but Good ultimately shines in the lead role, making this a quick and interesting binge.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Eve’s Bayou</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=true>Eve’s Bayou was the film that turned heads in the direction of a young Meagan Good. Barely 16 years old, the actress delivered a critically acclaimed performance as Cisely Batiste, establishing herself as one of the young talents to keep an eye out for.

Good stars as Mya, and joins Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, Taraji P. Henson, Terrence J, Regina Hall, Romany Malco, Gabrielle Union, Jerry Ferrara, and Gary Owen for some serious laughs. A sequel was released two years later in 2014.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Shazam! Fury of the Gods</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>Shazam!
