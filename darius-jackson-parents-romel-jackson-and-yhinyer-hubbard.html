He was born to them in January 1994, making him 29 years old in 2023.</p><p>Now, let us tell you about each one of them, individually and together.</p><h3><strong>Meet Romel Jackson, Darius Jackson’s Father</strong></h3><p>Romel Jackson’s full name is Romel Paul Jackson. And Darius is clearly very fond of them. He often shows him off and writes sweet words bout him on social media.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Romel Jackson Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Romel Jackson was born in July 1958.

And more than once, she has also been seen on his social media looking as happy as she can be. For instance December 2022, Darius shared with his people how his mom was so happy that they visited Michael Jackson’s home in Gary, Indiana.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Yhinyer Hubbard Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yhinyer Hubbard was born in September 1960.

He says things like how he was accepted more in the African American community growing up, though he was half Panamanian.</p><p>While he fully adopts to his Afro-Panamanian roots, growing up with a mixed heritage was not always easy for him. Looking back, he bitterly recalls how the Mexican kids were not as accepting. Because they were not open to hanging outing with him, he also did not want to be in the Latinos circle.
