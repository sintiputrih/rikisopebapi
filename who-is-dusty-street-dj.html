Wikipedia Biography Of The Radio Star</h2><p>Yet to have a Wikipedia, Dusty, a radio DJ, and engineer, has been active since the late 1960s and is considered one of the first female rock DJs in the United States.</p><p>For nearly 35 years, Dusty Street worked in the radio industry. On the radio in Los Angeles and around the country, she was the ultimate “Rock Jock.”</p><p>In contrast, Street gained prominence in 1967 while working for San Francisco’s&nbsp;<a href=#>pioneering&nbsp;</a>underground rock station KMPX and eventually transferred to KASN in 1969.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Radio DJ Dusty Street shares her story of how the <a href=#>@BroadcastersFDN</a> has helped her over the years.

She struggled to find work and maintain her medical coverage as the business shifted and the stations’ programming altered.</p><p>To make matters worse, she had to&nbsp;<a href=#>endure&nbsp;</a>much spinal surgery, and even though she had Medicare, her share of the medical bills was overwhelming.</p><p>Dusty sought and was approved for a monthly cash award from the Broadcasters Foundation of America at that time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-pimiso_com-medrectangle-4-0></span><h2 id=where-is-dusty-street-now>Where Is Dusty Street Now?</h2><p>DJ Dusty Street appears to be in her late 70s, as per her looks. However, because her exact age and date of birth are unclear, the following number is entirely speculative.</p><p>Besides, her real name is Dusty Frances Street. Her father’s name was Emerson Street, and they lived in Palo Alto on Emerson Street.</p><p></p><p>Her whereabouts, on the other hand, are rather tough to track down. Dusty Street was diagnosed with cancer twice in the 2016 video, and both times she battled it valiantly.</p><p>Furthermore, she also said that she underwent a variety of additional surgeries in 2005. Moreover, despite a 50-year career that she adored, Street was having challenges coping with rent and other issues.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-pimiso_com-box-4-0></span><h2 id=dusty-street-djs-husband-is-she-married>Dusty Street DJ’s Husband: Is She Married?</h2><p>Although DJ Dusty Street and her husband were married, the facts and specifics of her husband remain a mystery.</p><p>Furthermore, if she is married, it is possible that the famed DJ is a parent.
