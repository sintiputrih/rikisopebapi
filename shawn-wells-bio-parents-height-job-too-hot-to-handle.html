The guy even joined </span><i><span>Too Hot To Handle</span></i><span> season 4 in the middle of an ongoing season and chose <a href=#>Kayla Richart</a> to go on a date who was already coupled with Seb Melrose!</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Shawn Wells Bio explores this darer’s life.</span></p><h3><b>Shawn Wells On Too Hot To Handle</b></h3><p><span>Netflix’s </span><i><span>Too Hot To Handle</span></i><span> season 4 premiered on December 7, 2022, and as always there arrived brand new stunning ladies and a couple of handsome hunks on the shores of paradise. But Shawn Wells wasn’t one of them! He joined the show much later during episode 7 alongside Imogen Ewan and sent shockwaves throughout the villa.</span></p><p><span>Shawn’s confidant. He said if you Google “sexy black man,” he comes up, “You’ll see me, right there,” he added. So, he wasn’t on the show to play games. He even made it very clear right during his entrance stating he was going to walk in “like a Florida hurricane!”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, the Florida native added he had no issue stepping on people’s toes and wanted to “take Kayla from whoever she’s with.”</span></p><p><span>Promoting himself and the show, Shawn took to his IG to write, “The wait is finally over! Get your popcorn ready. Catch me on Too Hot To Handle streaming now on @Netflix!”</span></p><p><span>Also, boasting his stunning entrance impression, Shawn made TikTok videos walking like a boss, captioned, “How I felt walking into the villa on Too Hot To Handle.”</span></p><p><span>Prior to Shawn, his co-stars Brittan Byrd, Creed McKinnon, Dominique Defoe, James Pendergrass, Jawahir Khalifa, Kayla Richart, Nick Kici, Sebastian Melrose, and Sophie Stonehouse, were already in the villa.</span></p><h3><b>Shawn Wells Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span>Shawn Wells didn’t reveal if he came out of the villa with Kayla or not. And it only makes sense that he kept his relationship status wrapped up because </span><i><span>Too Hot To Handle</span></i><span> season 4 was still going on.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, this go-getter set his eyes on Kayla the moment he stepped into the villa. Even during the entrance promo, he said, “I’m taking Kayla from whoever she’s with.” And by “whoever” he meant Seb Melrose!</span></p><p><span>In case you missed Kayla and Seb’s romance, the two started out sleeping in the same bed after Kayla gave up on Nigel Jones. The two then started dating and it wasn’t long before Kayla admitted she had a soft spot for Nigel because he had expressed interest, was unapologetically funny, and was also generally shy.</span></p><p><span>Acknowledging their love, the show also gave the lovebirds the ultimate control test to demonstrate their compatibility — a romantic evening spent by themselves in the private suite, complete with booze, rose petals, and a two-person bathtub. So, it was then and there that the pair first showed that they were committed to the relationship.</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to ep 7, our star Shawn then threatened their relationship. But since Kayla had already decided, Shawn later turned to Jawahir Khalifa whilst referring to her as a&nbsp; “Black Queen.” Onbovusly, fans didn’t appreciate this.</span></p><p><span>“So Shawn sees that Kayla clearly has chosen to remain with Seb then he immediately diverts to “I love my black queens” for his backup plan, like NAH stay over there. The same old tactic they always pull whenever their preferences aren’t choosing them,” a user wrote.</span></p><p><span>While another tweeted, “Shawn is so unbelievably corny my god. any black man who says “I love my beautiful black queens” on tv does not date black women IRL.”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Shawn Wells?</b></h3><p><span>Shawn Wells was 25 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Too Hot To Handle</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is three years older than Kayla.</span></p><h3><b>Shawn Wells Height</b></h3><p><span>Shawn Wells stands tall at a height of 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) and weighs 102 kg (225 lbs).</span></p><p><span>His distinct features include — a thick beard and a fit body covered with tattoos.</span></p><h3><b>Shawn Wells Job</b></h3><p><span>Shawn Wells is a military man turned model and musician. He was in the Army Transportation Corps’ 88N at the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell. After receiving an Honorable Discharge, Shawn then turned to his passion for modeling whilst also trying his luck as a rapper.</span></p><p><span>He recently released a song called “Christmas Bae.” Checked it out on streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube.</span></p><p><span>When Shawn’s not working, he likes to hit the gym. In fact, every free time he has is spent lifting weights.</span></p><p><span>Shawn even has a body transformation video on his TikTok.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Shawn Wells Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Shawn Wells didn’t reveal his parents. But he once said that it was his mother who forced him to do runway ever since he would walk. “I was a runner-up for baby Ohio,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Guess, it was his mother who first carved the pathway to his career.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Shawn Wells Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Shawn receives his birthday wishes between January 20 and February 18. That makes him of the Aquarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Shawn Wells On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>As of 2022, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>shawnwells_1</span></a><span> with 122K followers.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>shawnwells_1</span></a><span> with over 118K followers.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Shawn Wells From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Shawn hails from Houston, TX. Or as he likes to call the “Dirty South.”</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, he resided in Miami, Florida.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrKCRrLtuw8Slo6xlkp68brzAq5ynrKNitaa1xqGrZqKfl3q1u85mn6isXam8brTAp5ulnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ed-sheerans-supermarket-flowers-about.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Ed Sheeran's 'Supermarket Flowers' About?">&larr;
