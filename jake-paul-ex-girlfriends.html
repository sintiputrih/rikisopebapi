The scoop on Jake's exes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@jakepaul</a></figure><p>Anyone keeping up with YouTuber and boxer <a href=#>Jake Paul</a> knows that over the years, Jake has broken many hearts. Jake's ex-girlfriends are sometimes fellow YouTubers who have been embroiled in scandals of their own (remember the time <a href=#>he got married</a>?), but for the most part, his breakups are often the first time fans learn of his exes.</p><p>We know that right now, <a href=#>Jake is dating Jutta Leerdan</a>, a Dutch speed skater whom he went public with in April 2023.</p><p>But who are Jake's ex-girlfriends? Read on for everything we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Julia Rose</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jake's ex <a href=#>Julia Rose</a> is a model who went viral for flashing a camera when it panned to her at the 2019 World Series. She has also appeared on MTV's Are You the One? It's unclear how she and Jake met, but they reportedly began dating around January 2020.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan Paul vlog</a> from March 2020, Jake announced to the camera that he was "hungover, depressed, and heartbroken because my girlfriend dumped me because I'm a f--king idiot."</p><p>After unsuccessfully begging Julia to take him back, including allegedly renting a billboard worth $2,000 to plead his case, it seemed at first that there were no signs of reconciliation between the two. But the two apparently remained on and off for a while, and by July 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake confirmed</a> they were a couple again. (Jake was <a href=#>briefly linked to model Sky Bri</a> around March 2021, during an "off" period with Julia.)</p><p>By December 2022, all signs pointed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake and Julia's breakup</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tana Mongeau</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The internet was unprepared for Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul's relationship. Dubbing themselves "Jana" to the public, the pair even went as far as&nbsp;<a href=#>getting (fake) married</a>, making YouTube videos together, and eventually creating several messy breakup videos. There were rumors that the pair split because&nbsp;<a href=#>Jake cheated on Tana</a>, but Tana later&nbsp;<a href=#>posted a YouTube video</a>&nbsp;saying they clashed because she didn't want an open relationship and Jake did.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Erika Costell</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Model, singer, and YouTuber&nbsp;<a href=#>Erika Costell</a>&nbsp;dated Jake in 2017. The pair even released a song together, titled "Chitty Bang," and filmed several YouTube videos in collaboration as well. The couple known as "Jerika" got together at a Miami Heat basketball game, where Jake publicly asked her to be his girlfriend after his split from Alissa Violet.&nbsp;</p><p>Jake wrote a lengthy Twitter post announcing their split in November 2018, claiming they had broken up a few months prior. Rumors of a potential reconciliation were sparked when they were&nbsp;<a href=#>spotted grabbing lunch together during his marriage</a>&nbsp;to Tana Mongeau, but the get-together appeared to be nothing more than a friendly chat.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alissa Violet</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Former&nbsp;<a href=#>Team 10&nbsp;</a>member&nbsp;<a href=#>Alissa Violet</a>&nbsp;dated Jake from 2016 to 2017, and "Jalissa" ended on a sour note when she accused him of mental and emotional abuse. Allegedly, the pair had great creative chemistry, but their breakup resulted in drama.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Jake reportedly kicked her out of the Team 10 house, and then, in since-deleted tweets, he accused her of cheating on him with Jake's brother,&nbsp;<a href=#>Logan Paul</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Saxon Sharbino</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saxon Sharbino</a> is the earliest of Jake's known exes. The pair allegedly dated in 2014. Saxon is an actress known for roles in Lucifer, Poltergeist, and American Vandal. While the details of their relationship are murky, the pair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filmed a video in 2017</a> titled "A Conversation With My Ex-Girlfriend," where they reminisced on their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ssYypmK6kXZrFbrPIq6Ofqpmau6W%2F</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./i-can-try-to-write-an-article-on-the-topic-of-gherbo-dead-here-is-a-possible-article.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I can try to write an article on the topic of gherbo dead.
