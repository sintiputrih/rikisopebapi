Lindsay Clancy, 32, has been&nbsp;charged&nbsp;with three counts each of murder and strangulation.</p><p>The labor and delivery nurse is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges in Plymouth Superior Court at a later date.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Hisham Awartani: GoFundMe set up for Palestinian Ivy League student shot in Vermont and tragically paralyzed from chest down</a></p><p>---------------------</p><p>DUXBURY, MASSACHUSETTS:<a href=# rel> Lindsay Clancy,</a> a 32-year-old mother who allegedly strangled her three young children before severely injuring herself in a suicide attempt, may never stand trial. She allegedly killed her <a href=# rel>5-year-old daughter, Cora,</a> her 3-year-old son Dawson, and her 8-month-old baby, Callan.&nbsp;</p><p>Clancy has been charged with <a href=# rel>first-degree murder,</a> three counts of strangulation and three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. However, there are claims as why she may not stand a trial even after killing three chidren.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Manuel Rocha: Former US ambassador arrested over accusations of secretly serving as agent for Cuba</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Disturbing phone note reveals Lindsay Clancy 'resented' her children before killing them</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Lindsay Clancy’s chilling calls to husband before murder of children may prove crime was 'premeditated'</a></p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Arizona student seriously injured in 'promposal'-gone-wrong sues school for $1M</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>'Lindsay Clancy may never stand trial'</strong></h2><p>Though the news of the murder came in as a shock, most of the psychologists are investigating the possibility of <a href=# rel>postpartum psychosis</a> in the 32-year-old. “I question whether she would ever make it to a trial. She suicidal. She’s extremely emotional. However, she’s unable and has been unable to express any happiness or sadness or cry,” said Kevin Reddington, Clancy's attorney.</p><p>He also claimed that the 32-year-old was overly medicated and going through severe postpartum depression and alleged that she was on12 different medications, including Prozac and Seroquel. These medicines also have side effects such as homicidal and suicidal ideation. Reddington also claimed that Clancy has even heard the voice of a man telling her to kill her children from within. During Clancy's court hearing, Reddington also argued, "This is not a situation that was planned by any means. This is a situation that clearly was a product of mental illness," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People.</a></p><p>Forensic psychiatrist Dr Ian Lamoureux said, "We do not see psychiatric medication, even when improperly prescribed and prescribed in excessive volume, to cause psychotic symptoms or homicidal thoughts. What it can do is cause a delirium, a medical state where you start to see psychotic symptoms occur." She also added, "It may be the case that she had a pretty significant underlying condition, and what was seen was more a result of the condition itself with medications … being increased to try to catch up to the symptoms," as per People. Lamoureux claimed that Clancy's potential postpartum psychosis diagnosis is "not a moral failure. It's not an issue of character. It's an issue of mental illness."</p><h2 class=split>'I do not think this will go to trial'</h2><p>The Internet too is debating whether she'll go to trial. A user said, "I do not think this will go to trial. Plea all the way, unfortunately. I also think both families would prefer that. I’m sure the media attention has been horrendous." Another added, "My guess is the only plea that would work on both sides would be a life sentence with the possibility of parole in a mental facility and no prison time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d11ff1ea-0ce2-4338-9137-68723c2e5faa.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/01f2e611-e0ba-4f4b-92da-bd5ba27ff947.JPG><p>"I definitely think it will go to trial. There was another case in this area of a black woman who murdered her baby. The same prosecutor went after her taking this to trial. She plead insanity. If the prosecutor doesn’t take this to trial it will look bad on him for going easy on a white mother," said another. A user noted, "How could they possibly find a fair, impartial jury that either isn't familiar with this case or who hasn't already made up their mind about her presumed guilt or innocence?."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/25d4c3b4-e26f-485a-9e92-1b40b1144193.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/cea52da9-0b0b-4a35-a2de-bee810c83ef6.JPG><p>Another claimed, "I am 100000% positive they will plead this out.In mass you do not have to prove you are sane, like most states would. Instead, the DA will have to prove that she was sane and that the meds she was on had absolutely no effect on her brain. Does anyone realize how hard that would be? Some of the benzos she was on can be in your system for well over 30 days. That alone will make it not guilty by reason of insanity. She will spend the remainder of her life in a locked psych ward, which may actually be worse than jail." "Do they have to prove that the meds had no effect on her brain? How many millions of people take meds and don’t commit crimes? How many murderers are on some kind of meds or drugs?I’m genuinely curious. It sounds like she was taking 3-4 meds at the time. That doesn’t seem like a lot. Am I crazy lol?," explained a user.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/19525a2f-cf87-474f-8f7e-42019375ee95.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/045b3e3e-c3b5-4dec-92be-aeeac6b87463.JPG><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
