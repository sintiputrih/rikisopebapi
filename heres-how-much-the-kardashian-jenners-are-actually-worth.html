Their rise to fame was both unique and unexpected. With the start of their E! Network reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, in 2007, the celebrity status of every single member of this famous family began to climb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Caitlyn Jenner to Kylie to Kris and beyond, the Kardashian-Jenner family has become seriously successful and boasts a massive net worth. While their claim to fame was definitely unconventional, the Kar-Jenners know how to take advantage of every opportunity that is presented to them.</p><p>Through hard work and success, the Kardashian-Jenners have become a household name. From reality television to modeling, makeup, and fashion lines, this beautiful family really does it all. We can’t help but wonder…how much are the Kardashian-Jenners actually worth?</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-a-self-made-millionaire-with-a-net-worth-of-over-370-million><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is A Self-Made Millionaire With A Net Worth Of Over $370 Million</span></h2><p>The fame that the Kardashian-Jenner family enjoys today is due to Kim Kardashian. Her controversial behavior and A-list friends earned her some level of recognition before Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>From the very beginning, Kim K. has pushed hard in the entrepreneurial game. She’s modeled, acted, endorsed, put out a mobile game, and created makeup, fragrance, and shapewear lines, and this is just a sampling of her business activities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to CheatSheet, critics say Kim Kardashian is famous for no reason, but her super-successful brand and $350 million net worth definitely give her some clout.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-lives-her-lavish-life-with-a-45-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Khloe Kardashian Lives Her Lavish Life With A $45 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>Khloe Kardashian has always been a fan favorite on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Her spunky personality and go-getter attitude captured our hearts. Khloe wasn’t always into the business side of things like Kim Kardashian, but she has definitely upped her worth in recent years.</p><p>Khloe has done endorsements, helped co-found an apparel label, done her own spin-off shows, and executive produced several projects. There’s a reason Khloe has the nickname, Khloe Money, and her $45 million net worth probably has something to do with it.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-s-net-worth-is-a-nice-35-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Kourtney Kardashian’s Net Worth Is A Nice $35 Million</span></h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian, the eldest Kardashian, has lived a lot of her adult life in the shadows of her younger sisters. But don’t count Kourtney out just yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While a lot of her $35 million net worth is believed to have come from her work on&nbsp;KUWTK, Kourtney also does a lot of endorsements and has her own online business. “The biggest thing that my dad always told us was just that money doesn’t buy happiness,” explained Kourtney to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>.</p><p>Kourtney has always said that being a mom is her life’s greatest ambition.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Lesser-Known Facts About Kim And Kourtney Kardashian's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-became-the-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-a-net-worth-of-1-billion><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Kylie Jenner Became The Youngest Self-Made Billionaire With A Net Worth Of $1 Billion</span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner is the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, but she’s also the wealthiest. Kylie became the youngest self-made billionaire last year with her net worth of $1 billion, according to Forbes.</p><p>Before selling the majority stake of Kylie Cosmetics in November 2019, Kylie owned 100 percent of the massively successful makeup line. This, combined with her TV money and endorsement deals, earned Kylie Jenner her impressive net worth at just 22-years-old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-jenner-s-modeling-career-pushed-her-net-worth-to-50-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Kendall Jenner’s Modeling Career Pushed Her Net Worth To $50 Million</span></h2><p>Kendall Jenner is unique among the Kardashian-Jenners, in that she has a paid job outside of television or owning a makeup company. According to Harper’s Bazaar, Kendall was the highest-paid model in the world in 2018.</p><p>Kendall’s $50 million net worth can be attributed to her modeling success, her reality television appearances, her work as an actress, and her work as a brand spokeswoman for several big-name companies, including Pepsi, Estée Lauder, and Adidas.</p><h2 id=momager-kris-jenner-works-hard-for-her-100-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>‘Momager’ Kris Jenner Works Hard For Her $100 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>Kris Jenner has to be one of the most successful “momagers” of all time and she has her talented and motivated daughters to thank for that. Kris Jenner has been called a branding and business wizard. She is the momager mastermind behind the Kardashian empire, according to E! News.</p><p>Kris charges her daughters a 10 percent management fee for every deal. She also makes a lot of money off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and her own endorsement deals. All of this adds up to her $100 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics That Prove Kardashian/Jenner Parties Are On Another Level</a></span></p><h2 id=rob-kardashian-s-net-worth-is-around-30-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rob Kardashian’s Net Worth Is Around $30 Million</span></h2><p>Rob Kardashian has never achieved the same success as his sisters, but he still does pretty well for himself. According to Metro, Rob Kardashian just isn’t happy in the spotlight these days and that’s understandable.</p><p>Despite his lack of public appearances in recent times, and an up and down personal life, Rob has a net worth of $30 million. His sock line, Arthur George, and his clothing line, Halfway Dead, definitely have something to do with it.</p><h2 id=caitlyn-jenner-and-her-life-s-work-is-worth-100-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Caitlyn Jenner And Her Life’s Work Is Worth $100 Million</span></h2><p>Catelyn Jenner has been working toward her net worth since her days as an Olympic gold medalist in the 70s. From her time on KUWTK to her own spin-off, I Am Cait, and other television appearances, Caitlyn Jenner has earned a net worth of $100 million.</p><p>Seventy-year-old Caitlyn was paid over $600,000 for appearing on&nbsp;I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, according to Metro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brody-jenner-s-television-and-modeling-career-play-a-role-in-his-15-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Brody Jenner’s Television And Modeling Career Play A Role In His $15 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>While Brody Jenner is not an immediate part of the Kardashian-Jenner family, he is the half-brother from Caitlyn’s previous marriage. Brody, though not as famous as his half-sisters, still holds his own in terms of reality television fame.</p><p>Brody Jenner was a part of a different reality television show for MTV, which was called The Hills. This was&nbsp;where he got involved with the show's main star, Lauren Conrad. Brody’s work as a television personality, model, and disc jockey all contribute towards his $15 million net worth.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-s-massive-career-helped-earn-him-a-300-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kanye West’s Massive Career Helped Earn Him A $300 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>When Kanye West and Kim Kardashian started dating, it was like all the stars aligned. Kanye was a huge name before ever marrying into the Kardashian-Jenner family and he came into the famous family with a huge net worth.</p><p>If ever there was a person to give Kim K. a run for her money when it comes to motivation to succeed, it would be Yeezy. His career as a rapper, songwriter, record producer, and fashion designer pushed him toward a net worth of $300 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-disick-lives-comfortably-with-a-net-worth-of-25-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Scott Disick Lives Comfortably With A Net Worth Of $25 Million</span></h2><p>Scott Disick’s claim to fame was as Kourtney Kardashian’s bad boy, outspoken, sarcastic boyfriend/baby daddy. He wasn’t always liked by the Kardashian-Jenners, but he was always favored by fans of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>Scott will always be the first to tell you he actually has real jobs outside of the reality show and his $25 million net worth validates this. Scott runs multiple companies, gets paid for nightclub appearances, and got his own “flipping and remodeling” show called Flip It Like Disick.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Facts About Scott Disick That Leave Us Scratching Our Heads (But Are Hard To Ignore)</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-and-kanye-s-kids-are-already-worth-millions-of-dollars><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kim And Kanye’s Kids Are Already Worth Millions Of Dollars</span></h2><p>This really shouldn’t come as any surprise, but the next generation of Kardashian-Jenners all have a large net worth, too, even though none of them are over the age of 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s children are loaded, though they might not know it. Just by being born, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm earned $10 million, thanks to a trust fund set up for them, according to Romper -&nbsp;and this amount just continues to grow.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-s-kids-won-t-struggle-when-they-re-adults><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kourtney Kardashian’s Kids Won’t Struggle When They’re Adults</span></h2><p>Mason, Penelope, and Reign Disick all made a ton of money from their time on Keeping Up with the Kardashian. According to Cafemom, when Mason was just two-years-old, he was already making about $3,000 per episode and according to Wetpaint, the older they are, the more they’re paid. So, we can assume that Mason and Penelope are making over $10k per episode now.</p><p>With all their added time on the reality show, the Disick children are estimated to be worth more than $500,000, according to CelebrityNetWorth.</p><h2 id=kylie-s-daughter-stormi-already-has-a-net-worth-of-more-than-3-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kylie’s Daughter, Stormi Already Has A Net Worth Of More Than $3 Million</span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner’s first-born daughter, Stormi Webster, is definitely following in her mommy’s footsteps when it comes to net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According OK!, Stormi was already worth at least $3 million, just weeks after being born.
