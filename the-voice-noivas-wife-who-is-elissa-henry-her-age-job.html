The country singer went with a song of his genre for Chris Stapleton’s “Cold” and for his last song, he went with Lenny Kravitz’s “Fly Away”.</p><p>In 2023, other than making a comeback in music with a feature on NBC’s The Voice has continued to have a joyful life with his partner Elissa Henry. Who she is, let us tell you in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Meet Elissa Henry, The Voice NOIVAS Wife</strong></h3><p>NOIVAS has been together with Elissa Henry since 2015.</p><p>On 15 February 2022, NOIVAS took to his Instagram <a href=#>@noivaswright</a> to tell the world that he and Elissa just had their 7th Valentine’s Day together. Also, he gushed that it is their first as human parents. To his Queen, he then said “I Love You” and added that he cannot wait to continue to be the perfect example of a loving, protective, and supportive partner for their little one(s) to grow up to be like. This is certainly not the first time, we have seen NOIVAS talk in length about Elissa. There have been many other occasions. Before this, one time, he even confessed that he would not be where he is today if it were not for his “beautiful Black woman, partner and best friend, in my life”.</p><p>Until May of 2023, NOIVAS was not once seen referring to Wlissa as his wife though. Even on his BIO on his own website (www.noivas.live/biography), she is only associated with him as his partner.</p><h3><strong>Elissa Henry And NOIVAS Kids</strong></h3><p>Together, Elissa Henry and NOIVAS are parents of two beautiful daughters, Bella and Ira, and their fur babies Abby and Bear.</p><p>Irys Rose, AKA Ira, turned 6 months old on 22 February 2023. And when this happened, NOIVAS took to his social media to explain how he started celebrating half-birthdays after losing his brother.</p><p>Isabella, AKA Bella Roux or little cowgirl, turned 18 months old on 19 January 2023.</p><p>Elissa and NOIVAS have always been really excited about their parenting journey. Back in September 2022, before Ira came around, the five of them, including their two fur and one human babies had rented out a villa on a private beach in East Florida for a week for their “Babymoon”. They thought of celebrating the occasion as their last vacation before they are parents of two.</p><p>Elissa particularly also enjoys birdwatching with her kids and running around with her dogs.</p><p>She also is an avid tennis fan. But, she prefers to play it than watch it. Also, when she is done even having fun with kids, legal dramas are what she tunes onto.</p><h3><strong>Is Elissa Henry On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Elissa Henry can be found on Instagram. As of 23 May 2023, her account here (<a href=#>@ellie_trill</a>) included&nbsp;78 posts and 694 followers.</p><p>Elissa also showed glimpses of her life on ‘Elissa Henry’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>. “There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you”, she wrote in her BIO here. Also, here, her most recently updated post was her informing people that voting for the finale of The Voice has closed. Also, she assured fans that no matter who wins, each of the top 5 contestants in the finale, including her own man, will have numerous opportunities to pursue a career in music.</p><h3><strong>Elissa Henry Age</strong></h3><p>Elissa Henry was born in 1989. So, she reached the age of 33 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Elissa Henry Job</strong></h3><p>In addition to thanking Elissa for being his muse, partner, and best friend, NOIVAS also has always appreciated Elissa for evolving into a perfect attorney. To the unversed, Elissa is a highly-qualified lawyer specializing in car accidents, probate, and family-based immigration.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, she has been the owner/managing attorney at Elissa I. Henry Law Firm in Austin, Texas since November 2016.</p><p>Elissa’s passion for this specific career started in 2001 after a pivotal personal experience. Her father was a victim of negligent driving and was forced into a hospital bed for months. During the entire time, Elissa visited her father daily after school and accompanied him for his physical therapy sessions. Her interest and involvement in his case eventually grew as she attended every appointment with his attorney.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Elissa Henry’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Elissa Henry’s birthday is on August 23rd and that makes her a Leo.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Elissa Henry From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Unlike her beau, Elissa Henry originally hails from New York, New York.</p><p>Crazy-about-hats NOIVAS, meanwhile, being the country boy that he is, NOIVAS has always settled himself not far than 25 miles outside of the Austin, Texas city limits.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Did Elissa Henry Earn Her Education?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Elissa Henry studied Doctor of Law (J.D.), Business Litigation at Baylor University School of Law (2013 – 2015).
